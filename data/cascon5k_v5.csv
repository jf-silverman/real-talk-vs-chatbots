2,CasualConversation,Why do so many Windows users dread new software updates?,I see so many Microsoft Windows users usually dreading and neglecting to update their computer to the new OS.

4,CasualConversation,Does anyone else think of the internet as a video game like world?,"I've pretty much grown up with the internet at this point, and I've always looked at it as entering this alternative, video game like universe. Websites are like different territories and sometimes it's almost like a mission or a quest in a video game. You gotta go back and forth between different territories on the internet to get the information/resources you need to accomplish your task. I legitimately have fun browsing the internet. Discovering new cool websites gives me the same type of excitement that I get when I'm playing actual video games and I unlock a new item/location/etc. In keeping with that theme, if you know of any cool websites, mention it! I'd love to check them out.",-af10-,1642210247

6,CasualConversation,Are reality shows like Undercover Boss faked now?,"I mean think about it. The show has been going on for years now. It's popular and so many people know it. For anyone's that's had multiple jobs, you know new recruiters/members/workers never come in with cameras on them. If someone is coming around with cameras and there's new people there, it just makes sense for there to be something going on

The majority of us will never work at a place (especially some small or family owners business) where professional camera crew come in and record us. The majority of new people (in a lot of places) don't act like complete squares. Especially during a pandemic too? How many places you know have a camera crew all in there, especially for new recruits? Like come on now lol

So my question is; are these shows faked nowadays?",TheRoyalDon,1642209685
7,CasualConversation,Found out I can live without my ex again,"Some background (very brief I promise). Me and my ex started dating about a year ago. He was 18 and I had JUST turned 15 a few days beforehand. He turned 19 two months into our relationship. He was living in Ireland I lived in America so we video chatted a lot and stuff. 

A few months back I finally got the courage to tell him our age difference made me very uncomfortable and everyone around me uncomfortable. I blocked him. 

Without him constantly calling and texting me, I was able to actually pay attention in school, have time for my chores, and make friends in real life because I wasn’t constantly worried about him. It was very nice, but I found myself crying and missing him often. I was starting to get unwell these past few weeks because I felt like I could never love anyone but him. 

Yesterday, I sent him a long long text saying I missed him and wanted him back. He accepted and I immediately went back to constantly being on my phone because I wanted to talk to him. He’s now almost 20 and I’m bordering on my 16th birthday, which is not a good age gap. He’s currently learning to drive, working to get a job with his disability and looking for an apartment. I am trying to pass chemistry and learn how to draw. We are in no way In a same area in life. 

I realized that today. I was texting him and I realized that there is no way that I can have him in my life and actually live my life. All I will do is message him and spend my life bending myself to his will and never be happy. Plus, I mean, a 20 year old wanting a barely 16 year old that’s still very immature is kind of creepy. 

So I told him I can’t be with him. He was incredibly pissed and told me I used people, but I honestly didn’t care. I blocked him and I am feeling better. I realized I can and will live without him. Because without him, my life actually STARTED. 

I’m so proud of myself. I broke the cycle. I stopped entertaining older pedophile men and decided to live my life, and for once I’m not itching for the next 20something year old to come along and take advantage of my loneliness. Because I’m not lonely any more.",GraceTheGraveDigger,1642208994

15,CasualConversation,thinking," 

Hello my name is Madison. and I'm tired of people complaining about everything everyone else does. see I've been on TikTok. and they try to talk about people they find toxic. or naming and telling others they have mental issues. like OCD. ADHD. Anxiety. or .Bipolar disorder. or Depressed. or Schizophrenia. now this is true people do have these things. but it seems like people are trying to be doctors. or therapist. everyone has their own issues. but the way they talk you'd think they were perfect. if they were so perfect and happy why are they online complaining and talking about others?. if I'm happy, I Don't have time to think about what some psycho is doing. they are being holier than thou. by pointing out other peoples issues. because at a point people stop minding their own business and mind others by always talking about peoples flaws. they make it seem like their perfect. and we are just idiots who are stuck being weirdos . they want us to think we are bad for having mental problems. and they are better. but having a mental issue is hard on the family and us too. since most find it hard to control though it can be controlled. its hard but we get blamed till we're normal like them. then when we are we get blamed for not caring about people who have mind issues. or living our best lives. they think we're selfish. you cant win for losing. so I need to understand and have people help me know its okay to live for you. and not need people patting you on the back telling you your good. I think the only people who really care about peoples approval are the people who have been told their a burden or there's something wrong with you. people who cant be told anything because they think they are better don't listen. or care when someone doesn't like their decision making. its hard to be able to do what you want after years of people trying to make you feel bad for being happy. also its something I'd say I and lots have put on them selves feeling guilty about being you. since no one likes you and also sometimes others put it on you.",Reasonable_Adagio749,1642204727

23,CasualConversation,Which side would you pick?,"I had a debate with my cousin where he was saying if he had money he wouldn't mind staying in a third world country because he can have anything with the money and you wouldn't need anything from a developed country.

I on the other hand disagreed and said if I had money I would stay in a developed country because basically it is a plus.

We currently live in a third world country, and we lack certain stuff like not 24 hour electricity, not well developed roads and the list goes on.
He said all these problems wouldn't matter if he had money since he could buy generators and solar energy systems, etc and I replied saying I wouldn't need that in a developed country. We kept going in a loop of him saying if he has the money paying wouldn't matter. 

These are some of the examples we talked about.

33,CasualConversation,Finally making the first step to being a foster parent,"Since I was 8 years old I dreamt of being a foster parent. It's just been something that's burned inside of me since i was a child. I never wanted to have kids of my own and the older I get the less I want them. When my husband and I bought and fixed up our home I did it with the intention of taking in kids. Recently he built a Murphy bed and after he showed it off to me he started telling me how well it will work for kids as an emergency foster care place. It was then that it really started to hit me and I became excited. I completed the intake form and soon will start attending training sessions. My husband is working hard towards this beside me, happy to take on this dream with me. He pushed me to start the process this weekend and now our names are officially in the system. You might think I'm naive moving forward with this, or crazy, as a woman in her mid twenties with no children but I'm hardly even scared. I work with youth at risk, volunteer and used to work in homeless shelters so I'm not unfamiliar with the world of hurting people.

46,CasualConversation,How do I stop a bully?,"I'm a high school student in 9th grade and sice this year there's a new kid in my class.

Well, ever since this kid got into our class, he was acting like he was an expert on everything, that he was the most important, etc, etc. This was because of 2 reasons: 1. He skipped a class in primary, and 2. His aunt is a very beloved teacher at my school, so he doesn't really get punished for anything he does.

Well some friends in our group knew him so he joined our group, but ever since then he only caused trouble: bullying, destroying school and personal property, and then getting out of trouble because of his so called ""status"".

During lunch break (which is an hour long in Belgium) he starts to steal others bags and throw them. I always put my bag on my back when he begins with his shenanigans, because I have my iPad in there (everyone in school needs one, but I have a pro because I like to program and edit on it, I paid around 2000 euros for it so I'm really careful with it). But then he starts ridiculing me about it and he rest of the group (around 10 people) follow his lead. This also happens for anything that happens that he gets information on.

Because of personal situations I'm not that extroverted and assertive anymore, and my mental status also isn't great. So anything that happens really hurts me. I want him to get a reality check so he stops being a spoiled brat and learns how he must act. He basically doesn't think before he does anything (he already destroyed a classmates iPad and anothers schoolbag) and hasn't aged mentally since maybe 3rd grade.

I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, but can anyone give me some advice on what to do? It's already getting out of hand because I heard from someone that his plans were going to do some real harm (he wanted to throw fireworks in my parents car) so I want to stop that from happening. Thank you all for reading and hopefully someone can give me some advice.

47,CasualConversation,"Music, movies, influencers, shows etc... should not use the n-word THIS MUCH","I am not an American and I am not African but I find it truly confusing how such a derogatory term like the n-word is being literally plastered EVERYWHERE IN MEDIA ALL THE TIME.   

I was listening to a rap song today and DAMN between an n word and an n word there is an n word. Same goes when I am watching the insta stories of some dark skinned celebs  (like Cardi B for example)  

I truly don’t understand the concept. I am not fully educated about the history of the term and it’s true weight but I am pretty sure it holds a sinister intent of degrading people who are dark skinned.   

Therefore, I am confused as to why this word in not totally retired and instead is used 100x times more, in all types of entertainment.   

It is used so much that it becomes infiltrated in the subconscious of every non english speaking person who is learning the language through movies, music etc... In other terms, imagine if everyone in your household curses constantly, then because you hear curses all day you might curse sometime by accident. Not because you mean the curse, but because you hear it so much. Which in the case of the n word is so counterproductive for the fight against racism.  

I don’t know if I am making sense. I think my question is, why not just remove the word completely from everyday vocabulary?  

I really don’t want to offend anyone. I truly mean this from a place of love and appreciation for Africa and its people and I hate to hear this word a million times a day.",ThisIsLionn,1642189292

As a smoker I understand how hard it is to quit, but also as a smoker I understand the *importance* of *trying* and *wanting* to quit. As a smoker I understand cigarettes are a scam, they are bullshit and they are a greedy money cash grab from the government, who makes people addicted on purpose to keep giving them money. I hate people that support cigarettes blindly when they are never affected by it. Just a lot of naive, irrelevant opinions with it lol. But that's not the situation. 

Is it natural, is it okay, is it normal, for me to feel anger towards cigarettes and for me to feel let down, sad and annoyed that my mother won't even attempt to quit after years of heavy coughing that's just getting worse? Like it feels like I'm going to lose her because it's like she just doesn't care about her health, about staying alive for my son and just her family in general. You could ignorantly call me selfish all you want but caring about your mother's health and life doesn't make me selfish. Smoking while family is constantly worried about you does. That isn't the point tho. 

It feels like I'm some negative, fucked up person for constantly feeling sad, annoyed and lowkey depressed how much my mother's health is being affected and knowing there's nothing I can do for either because she isn't trying to help herself with it. I'm working on myself trying to quit but I'm not in the same situation as her, which is what I'm trying to prevent for the future tbh.

I was just expecting to observe to see how meetings went and what was involved.   


They started off with impromptu speeches where a member is selected to speak 'off-the-cuff' for up to 2 minutes to answer a specific question - related to the general topic of pets, which was selected for that evening. I was picked as the third speaker and was given a difficult moral question to talk about (Is an animal's life worth less than a human being?)  


I was so nervous - I was tempted to just drop off the call. But I took a deep breath, thought on my feet and managed to string together a coherent-ish answer. I felt relieved after I did it and I received really good feedback, considering it was a difficult topic. I was even voted as the best speaker for that section!

Food scarcity is something I'm pretty fearful of. Being in Canada, with so much food imported here, the supply chain being pretty haphazard right now and increase in grocery prices, I'm feeling very grateful and fortunate to have this. I've dealt with food insecurity for a long while, especially in my teenage years with a single parent and moreso as a young adult who didn't know how to cook.

135,CasualConversation,Coming to terms with being unattractive is rough,"I think I finally realise i'm not as attractive as I thought I was. 

And it sucks.

I kind of sat there and thought about it and was like ""ive never really been complimented, at all"". And never by strangers ever.

Instead, I remembered the times people said I was outright ugly

One time a girl walked by me in hs and literally just said ""you're ugly"" no prompt nothing just said it for no reason

Another time I passively said i feel like im unattractive and the girl just said ""dont be mean to yourself"" and so i said wait so i am and she just said it doesnt matter dont be mean to yourself

Oh and the time a girl i liked was on video call w me, and she decided to walk to her mum and say what do you think of this guy and pointed her phone to her mum with me on it and her mum recoiled and said ew. That one stung.

One time when I was on a msging app i didnt have a photo up and a girl started flirting w me saying she bets that im cute and made me send a photo and when i did she said ohh nvm youre not my type but you definitely could be other peoples type :) 

And so yeah, i stared at myself im the mirror the other day and picked apart all the things i dont like about myself and things that i feel make me ugly and now my self esteem is drained.. i am beginning to hate myself and the way i look",moonandcoffee,1642142412
136,CasualConversation,I appreciate my mom a lot more after having kid,"I’m first time mom of a 4-month-old boy. I thought becoming a parent is hard but I have never thought it is ‘this’ hard. Ever since I gave birth she has been a constant help for me, from cooking to caring for the baby so I can sleep to cleaning around the house. She is over 60 and has a bad back but she is always worried about me breaking my back for the baby and don’t have enough rest. Honestly she saved my marriage since my husband can’t handle Al of this child caring stuff. 

Now I understand much more about how she cared for me when I was small when my dad was out at work. And how she is always worried about me as I’m constant worried about my baby too. I also used to ask her why she did this did that in a kinda blaming way. But now I understand. She is also just a mom trying to do the best for me and she loves me no matter what. 

I also feel so sad that many people don’t appreciate how much work women putting into child care and child raising especially for men who mainly work and rarely care for small babies. I used to think men can be as good as women at children but the more time I spent on mom groups and talk with my friends I realize not a lot of men actually put as much effort and thinking into childcare and house maintaining as I thought. Sure they work and bring money home when the wife is on maternity leave but little did they know how hard it is for the wife spending 24/7 with small babies. A lot of men in my country still said “my wife only stays at home, taking care of the kids and cooking. What is so tiring about it?” . It is such a mind blowing experience becoming a parent and now I know why it is so tiring and honestly salute to all dedicated moms out there. 

People should really talk about how hard being a parent to small babies and children are and why you shouldn’t blame moms for all the things that went wrong because she is a human too after all.",heisei,1642141849

the transition to university (2020) was extremely difficult and since then i’ve known it was getting worse and worse - so i’m honestly just proud of myself for finally working up the courage to do this, it doesn’t seem like much but for years i made myself just “deal with it” and to no one’s surprise, that obviously wasn’t good for me.

being from an asian immigrant household in a mental health-positive country definitely made this a lot more difficult than it should be (mental health is non-existent to them lmao) but i’m so grateful to my best friend who kept telling me that seeking help would be good for me. i know the first month of meds might be difficult but in the end i hope it’ll be worth it - sometimes you just need a push to go in the right direction.

I felt so uncomfortable and like any sense of privacy I may have had in this area, with almost no people and just trees around. I hated it. And I never saw who was flying it.

A few weeks later we were visiting family in a suburb of the actual city in my state. And I heard that same obnoxious buzzing. Looked up, and sure enough it was a drone. I was walking through an alley with my dog, and kept walking, and it just kept hovering above me. Eventually a couple blocks later I saw the guy who was flying it in his back yard. Usually when I see someone while I'm out walking, I'll like smile or wave or nod. But I gave that guy one of the dirtiest looks I've ever given.

152,CasualConversation,"Why can people never explain what they mean by wanting world peace? Is it just an empty platitude, or does someone somewhere have an actual plan for world peace?","I was talking to someone earlier about “world peace” and I’ve had many similar conversations over the years that just veer off into abstract hipty dipty land. (See below if you’d like an example to read that for an example of what I’m talking about). No one who advocates for world peace can ever articulate how exactly we would make that happen. No one can ever tell me how we can measure our success as we’re working towards our goal or even how we’ll know when we’ve reached our goal. No one can ever tell me who will organize a world with billions of people and hundreds of countries and all speak different languages and have different cultures and everything. How will we all work together towards this shared goal? Who will keep us accountable? Anyone who’s ever worked on a group project or managed a team knows how difficult it is to get humans to work together on a project so I have serious concerns about getting the whole world on board with one shared goal like this, especially something as abstract and subjective as “peace”. No one ever talks about this like it’s a serious idea. They just talk about things like “harmony” and “understanding” and other things that can never possibly be achieved on a global scale. So it leaves me to wonder… is the whole “world peace” thing just an empty platitude that we’re all saying to each other to virtue signal? Or are there people somewhere actually working on this as if it’s a serious endeavor?

I suspect you’re going to tell me that’s what government is for but it’s not like they have “world peace” budgets or give yearly speeches updating us on the status of the world peace project. They may run on the idealistic idea of changing the world but I’m asking about an actual specific action taken and subsequently achieved.


This person said they wanted world peace and I asked them to describe what exactly that meant and they said
&gt; What that means is there's enough strife in the whole babylon kingdom that we as a world community want peace and respect to live our days free from persecution and retribution. No War, or call to arms. Now more than ever, the earth needs guardians whom are responsible and accountable for their actions. A consciously led community through Love and harmonious interaction. Yes, differences certainly arise, but can't we all smile a little more? Fucking - forgiveness, for our malice and imperfections that we don't push the envelope to hatred and persecution for differing tit for tat I can't see the necessity to why we as a humanity have to stoop to fussing and fighting. Beyond comprehension in MSM public narrative. Lord knows, I don't have every answer, but can't the bleating lamb be HEARD as something not ignored as a tree falls lonesome in the woods, thus does it make a sound? I say there's a vibration.

So I was reminiscing on that, and I realized something

I did not react.

My eyes were wide and unblinking.

My face was emotionless.

My mind went blank.

So as he, my ***best friend,*** was telling me how about how great I am, I was wide-eyed staring directly at him, without a thought in my mind.

163,CasualConversation,high school problems,"I am a senior in high school going onto my 2nd semester. I am a fairly motivated student who takes AP's and understands the importance of studying and working hard. 

This past semester, however, has been incredibly hard on me for a multitude of reasons.

For one, my school requires me to take AP Calc AB and AP Biology in order to graduate with their respective diploma. It also requires about 100 hours of volunteer work and maybe some other prerequisites as well. 

I was never a star student when it came to math. I struggled to grasp concepts but I managed to pull through from time to time.  I managed to get a 69 semester average in my Calculus class which was a little disappointing but nothing that I can't fix in this upcoming semester.

My other AP courses, Statistics and Biology, came out ok but they were definitely not the best. (2 C's)

Secondly, I made the decision to take AP Comp Sci during my fall semester as well. This came to be one of the worst decisions in my high school career and it has been the bane of my existence for the last couple of months. 

The class itself counts for two AP credits which means it basically counts for two separate grades. This means that a failing grade in the class absolutely decimates your GPA.

I managed to get a 60 average for the course (two 60's basically) which made me pretty sad.

For the past few years at high school, I've been studying for hours to get A's or B's in my courses so I just felt completely distraught at the sight of this.

I'm dropping the course this upcoming semester but I still feel down over it. Especially when colleges take a look at your fall semester grades when considering your application. 

I guess I feel down because I know I am someone who will put in the work to achieve something no matter what. These grades aren't a reflection of my own self and I understand that but that looming sense of failure simply doesn't go away.

I don't typically vent because I tend to keep feelings to myself but I needed to get this out there. If anything, I'm simply looking for some sort of reassurance. 

How do I handle failure? How can I do better in the future?",hyporcrite-,1642132350

But somewhere around my late 20s, I realized that I’ve stopped buying clothes. I only get new ones to replace the old torn or worn-out ones, but I’ve always made sure to get the exact one or almost the same style now.

When my wife and I decluttered our house, we threw away everything that we haven’t used for more than a year. It left me with a severely empty closet.

I guess it’s a good thing. I’ve finally found the “me” that I’m most comfortable to be. Perhaps I’ve stopped being self-conscious nor caring what other people might think about my style, and just wore what I feel is right for me?

I dunno. I’m in my mid-30s now and I still feel like a kid. To young people out there, I don’t think we will ever grow up. We’ll just stumble our way through life, guessing how to do this adulting thing forever. And it can be fun.

Fast forward to the 14th of January 2022, 12:35am, talking about Harry Potter 24/7 posters of Harry Potter in my room, watching interviews and videos and searching about facts on Harry Potter, to get the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets game on the PS2 to getting the first edition books of the Harry Potter books, becoming a big fan of the books and even planning to go and experience the Harry Potter experience in London soon, i closed the book to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows with just a big smile on my face.

I haven’t been so devoted to any book/comic like this in such a while and can’t remember the last time i have been so obsessed with a franchise before. These books J.K Rowling have created are absolutely amazing pieces of work and honestly, these books will always be special to me no matter how old i grow. these books are just too great honestly, words can’t describe how i enjoyed these books. these books are absolutely stunning pieces of work and i don’t know if i ever get to experience a book like this ever again. just the amount of joy i had reading this book is unreal honestly.

again, i’m so glad i found a place and a community where so many people across the world love/enjoy Harry Potter as much as i do and i’m sure each every single one of you guys are just fantasying of being in Hogwarts right now. i honestly wish there was a Hogwarts but i’ll never stop dreaming and will always have the books so i can just go back whener i want!

again, without disturbing any of you guys day or wasting you guys time,  hoping you guys are having a wonderful day and you guys are wonderful people! never forget that:)please feel free to ask any questions or anything to discuss down below!

184,CasualConversation,Finally gonna go out in public in a chest binder,"I would like to clarify first that I’m not transgender. I’m a drag king. Part of being a kind is using a chest binder. I wish not to offend any trans people. I’m just trying to gush on something I do. 

So I’d recently gotten the binder and was (still am) really happy about it.so far though, the most I’ve done with it is try it on in my room and see what different shirts look like. I still live with my parents for various reasons I really don’t have much control over. They also don’t know about drag. Mom doesn’t know about it because she seems to be confused by drag and it’s community. Dad doesn’t because I just don’t know how to explain it to him. 

Well, mom is going to a scrapbooking group thing that’ll happen all weekend. Not sure how it’ll work. I don’t scrapbook. This’ll be the first time I’ll get to wear the binder in public. I’m just going to the next town over to see the new Scream movie and grab some lunch, (because there’s not a theatre where I live currently) but it’s something. I’m really happy about this. Get to see a movie and wear the binder in public with an almost 0% chance of bumping into someone I know. With any luck, it’ll be great.",Cranky-Novelist,1642121229

186,CasualConversation,So I’m starting to realize the truth about becoming an adult,"Late assignments. In elementary school we were told, “your teachers in middle school won’t tolerate late work, so start being vigilant.” Turns out, most teachers in middle school were fairly lenient about it. Then they said the same thing in middle school about high school. High school teachers were also pretty lenient depending on your situation. Then my high school teachers would say, “most college professors will not stand for late work and will refuse to grade it at all.” Now I’m in college and most of my professors care less about late work than my high school teachers.

Good friends. I had some close friends as a small kid, but I moved to a new city and lost them. At my new elementary school I found good friends who stuck with me in middle school, then everything became drama and it turned out they were pretty fake. Everyone promised me: “The good, lifelong friends will find you in high school.” When I found my high school friends, I thought that was true! “These are the friends that will stick with me forever,” I told myself. Then, the drama hit again and we all drifted apart. Then, like a skipping record, people told me “The good, lifelong friends will find you in college.” I have found some pretty great people in college, and a tight knit group, but truthfully, we fight so often I highly doubt we will stick together through *life*. 

Now that I’m at the age where I work with/am around older adults more often, I’m realizing that it never stops! The same problems that we have in elementary school seem to follow everyone through adulthood. Finding true friends is still an extreme rarity, drama is still prevalent and even middle aged adults take part in petty gossip.

We are told adulthood will be this hugely different world, you will feel like an adult, know how to take care of yourself, the drama will go away, and you’ll find sincere friends - when, now that I’m peaking behind the curtain, every adult tells me they feel like they’re 16 in an older body. It feels a bit like finding out the truth about Santa, lol

I don’t know what I’m trying to say here honestly, lol. This post comes off a bit more negative than I intended it to. What are your thoughts on this? Do you still feel like a kid sometimes? Do you think it’s possible to avoid these problems in life?",pnweiner,1642118648

I’m so grateful for her, and it feels so good having a day to look forward to celebrate our love for each other every year.

195,CasualConversation,colleague appears to be discreetly touching herself during meetings,"I (46m) meet regularly with a female colleague (30f) via video chat.  We've never met in person, and both are working remotely in different locations.   Our discussion is strictly professional / work-related.  Sometimes in small groups, sometimes one-on-one.   

One of the first things I noticed is that she rarely wears a bra under her shirts.  It's not obvious, and you would only notice if she stretched or turned a certain way.  Personally, I wouldn't wear a bra either working from home, so have zero problem with this.   The majority of the time, her video is shoulders up, so there's really nothing of concern.   

However, when she crosses her arms, I can tell her hands are directly over where her nipples would be, and she makes subtle movements with her fingers that appear to be oriented toward stimulation.   Again, it's not overt, it doesn't seem to be ""creepy"", possibly not even intentional.   And then if she stretches/stands up afterward, it's pretty clear that her nipples are hard.   It's rare, maybe once out of every few meetings that this is even noticeable.  

She also ""bounces"" on her chair more than usual during these perceived stimulation times, similar to the amount of bounce you'd get from wiggling your leg absentmindedly.  Again, none of this is ""proof"" of anything, it's just a little bit unusual.  No-one has said anything to me about this, and I haven't brought it up with anyone.  

Not trying to make a big deal about this, nor would I consider raising any concerns.   Just seems uncommon and slightly strange.

None of my other female colleagues even remotely do similar things, so that's why it stands out a bit more.   She's never ""flirted"" with me, and seems generally engaged and professional in her behavior.  

Wasn't sure where else to post this, but I wanted to hear other folks thoughts or if I'm being unusually sensitive to this.",Kylearean,1642115452

221,CasualConversation,What do you think about using someone else's art for personal reasons?,"I ran across a tweet talking about using other people's DnD characters in your own personal campaigns. They talked about how their creations are very personal and for someone else to use these creations at all is very hurtful. There was debate about this idea, one side saying this is stealing and the other side arguing that it isn't. The conversation is fairly nuanced, so I can't adequately summarize here. 

I don't want to link the specific tweet I'm referencing, but what do you guys think?

My personal opinion is that there's a lack of understanding or maybe a lack in conversation about the creator/consumer contract (not sure if that's the actual term for it, but that's what I'm using), and how much of responsibility when it comes to the use of art falls on the creator and how much falls on the consumer. I think if someone's art is something very personal, they should probably avoid posting it anywhere on the internet because literally nowhere is safe from Google. If they do post online, maybe to keep in mind that someone might accidentally or intentionally use their art for unintended purposes. I also think consumers need to accept that art has to be created by a person who has their own feelings and intentions, and to respect that. 

There's a lot more to this conversation, but I just wanted ask if anyone had any insights about it.

Full disclosure, I have to do a research paper for my college English class, and this might be the topic i go with. It's also a personal interest, but if you say something really insightful, I may ask permission to quote you.

As I walked home last night  
I saw a lone fox dancing  
In the cold moonlight.

I stood and watched. Then

The night was his by right.

Sometimes, when words ring true,  
I'm like a lone fox dancing  
In the morning dew.

My favorite one was the Bruce Banner one saying ""that's my secret captain, I'm always angry"". Loki and Hulk were everyone's favorite characters. Thanos was an absolute mystery after the credits. Soundgarden playing the credits song which I remember looking forward to that when this movie came out. The following years after this movie came out I didn't really keep up with the series as often until Infinity War came out. Mostly because I felt the superhero genre was a little overdone but I wish I had kept up with the series as they were coming out. A lot of people loved Guardians of the Galaxy when it came out I remember. Good movie, wish I could relive it for the first time.",FaviniTheGreat,1642098373

247,CasualConversation,Does anyone else feel like they are easily misunderstood?,"I've been thinking about this lately, and I can't help but think that people misunderstand my personality. I very much care about others, am highly empathetic, and deeply desire to know everything about a person. Not the superficial stuff, but the deeply intimate parts of them. Stuff like what is right or wrong, what is beautiful, what is reality, what is truth etc. And I am really good at discussing this with people because I genuinely want to know for the sake of knowing them, I'm not judging them. With the caring aspect, I want the best for everyone, even if I barely know you, or we don't get along. As long as you are not trying to actively hurt me, I will help you out when I can, probably more so than I need to.  


I'm also very 'go with the flow' and very low maintenance. As long as my absolute bare needs are met and I am not extremely uncomfortable, I'm good.

&amp;#x200B;

Combine the two, and you get something that can easily look like a doormat. Someone who looks like a people pleaser who agrees with everything you say and does everything you want.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I can be extremely assertive at times. I know who I am, what I want, what I like and don't like, and what I want. I am not afraid of telling you exactly what I think, but I try to say it in the least offensive way.

&amp;#x200B;

When I get stressed, I get extremely sensitive. I know from past experiences, I can get even more assertive, but it can be detrimental because being too assertive will rub people the wrong way. So I tend to heavily back off of my assertiveness with friends and romantic interests when I am stressed because I don't want to offend them. But if this happens early on in a romantic relationship, you pretty much see a doormat, which no one wants.

&amp;#x200B;

I do it because I would prefer getting hurt by someone I care about rather than hurting someone I care about. But then you see someone who agrees with you seemingly all the time and does whatever you want. Someone who seemingly has no personality of their own. Someone who is super into learning about you, but doesn't seem to share much about themselves. Someone who is easy and boring.

291,CasualConversation,"I just came back from a meditation retreat, and want to share my experience","TLDR in the end

Happy new year to everyone! I hope you have a good one.

I was on a Vipassana retreat from 1st Jan to 12th Jan, and I'd like to share my experience here, in brief. I attended the centre in Bangalore, India.

\-----**THE GOOD**\------

1. The place was very clean and tidy. The food was healthy.
2. Management was quick to solve any problems of the meditators.
3. There is no feeling of a cult, and the discourses given by SN Goenka are very non sectarian, and for most parts not dogmatic.
4. SN Goenka is a humorous man, and obviously very empathetic. You get a lot of good vibes while listening to his discourses.
5. A lot of emphasis is put on actually practising meditation instead of mere philosophising, and one realises soon that it is not easy as it seems. One of my cherished learnings would be the realisation that things are always convenient to philosophise. In the end, it's the direct application that matters. I hope to apply this more frequently in my life.
6. Continued meditation would help foster a habit, and one will be able to see the changes in their psychology. You get less judgemental about your own thoughts, and start de-loading your baggage.
7. I hallucinated a lot of images when I started to meditate. A lot of buried memories from the past started surfacing which carried a lot of emotions. Eventually, I was able to understand them for what they really were, and found peace with them.
8. On the last day, you are allowed to talk with your co-meditators, and I found all of them to be really nice.
9. After initial difficulties, I did not miss my mobile phone.
10. I realised that I was eating more food in real life than my body needed.

\-----**THE NOT SO GOOD**\------

1. A lot of emphasis has been made to reconcile Vipassana teachings with science, which leads to hazy theories about matter and mind. IMO, this could have been avoided, and the practise of Vipassana should be judged on the basis of how it benefits it's practitioners, and not how 'close' it is to the 'real' science.
2. Historically, the relation between the Vipassana practise and Buddha is not as close as what Goenka will make you believe. They should be more transparent about this fact.
3. At times, during discourses, Goenka talks about things like prophecies, reincarnation, good/bad vibrations, which gets you iffy. He does keep on reminding you not to take his or even Buddha's word on face value, but explore things for yourself. At the subliminal level though, this can bias an uninitiated meditator.
4. They try really hard to make you not leave. I wanted to quit 2 times, and both the times the assistant teacher convinced me not to leave. I wanted to leave the first time on my 4th day because I was getting very bad nightmares. The second time was on my 7th day because I thought I have already gotten the most I can out of the course. In hindsight, I am glad I stayed because It would have been very selfish to leave on the 7th day.

\----**TLDR----**

Good for the most parts, apart from some pseudoscience in between. All in all, a great place to clear your head, and have some time off of civilisation. It affords you the time to decompress and realise more about yourself. Would definitely recommend.",Samuraiiii_Jack,1642071089

298,CasualConversation,Why do other countries with high gun ownership don’t fear sudden gun violence as much as people and police in the US does?,"It appears aside from the US countries like Iceland(which almost have a gun per family unit), Scandinavian countries including Finland, And Switzerland, Austria, Israel, Serbia, and several EU countries also have relatively high rates of gun ownership and somewhat permissive gun laws. And the EU currently lack border checkpoints and crossing countries is similar to crossing state or provincial borders.  But interestingly these countries and their police hardly have any fear of encountering gun violence while interacting with citizens or vice versa. Iceland only had one officer involved shooting and one murder via firearm for the last hundred years. I heard despite high gun ownership officers rarely carry their guns. I be curious why?

Is it because their black market for guns are not as bad as the US?",Jcs609,1642064763

But I feel kind of guilty that after years of having the same dentist I now switched and kind of wonder what she'll think when she gets back, but she was always a tad rough and rushed (not her fault, I know there are probably other appointments), and the other one I had today took things slower.

I woke up to the noise of faint scratching in my ear tonight. I thought it was water so I kind of played with my ear a but to make it come out but to no avail, and the noise was inconsistent so I came to the conclusion that there was a bug in my ear and my stomach drops. I run to the bathroom grab a q-tip and mush around in there to try and get it. I get it out and it's a small almond shaped bug, about the size of a sesame seed.


I do some research and it looks similar to body lice. I start crying. I hope this bug didn't lay eggs in my ear, but most importantly. I'm not in a good situation right now. So I can't just wash all my clothes and bedding in hot water and soap. It's also 12 at night so I can't do an inspection of all my stuff because my family is sleeping. I want to talk to my parents about it but they are both asleep and I really don't want to wake them up. 


At this point I've been standing in the bathroom for half an hour trembling, for God knows why. I'm 18, I really don't need to be freaking out like this, and I have school in the morning so I need to sleep, but at this point I'm wide awake terrified of waking up to more scratching noises in my ear.

314,CasualConversation,"Got rejected, Went on tinder thinking I would get no matches...I was wrong!","So I’m (M/25) not trying to gloat or anything, just sharing some experience. I got rejected when I asked out this girl, and thought “damn, I hope I’m not ugly” Or “Is there something wrong with me, that I can’t personally see”? “Am I awkward or creepy”? All my life I’ve had bad self esteem about myself, and that was my first time really reaching out like that, so it kind of hit me hard as my first official rejection. I went on Tinder thinking I might get a match or two, but in 45 minutes, I got 18! My settings were ages 18-27 and 20 miles out. A few of the girls are really cute too! The reason why I’m sharing this, is because I was wrong about myself, and realized that my insecurity might not be based on real logic. Maybe someone reading this might have a strong insecurity that they are completely wrong about too. Who knows, until you put it to the test.

Ps: I updated my bio to a funny pros and cons list, and have two photos of myself, a photo and video of me skateboarding, and one wakeboarding. I had tinder once before and those same photos *without* a good bio got me like 2 matches. I think showing humor helps a great deal.

I am going to be visiting in a month or so, see some of the big city stuff that is there. They called me last week before I bought my tickets and told me they had a date coming up and they would understand if I didn't want to come. I still got the tickets. I'll still be going and trying some theme parks or local sights. 
 
I feel a void though. All these steps apart into something new. From us being people who talk often  to who knows what, maybe talking once a month or not at all. Because that's how it went with my old friends, they got married and now we are lucky to talk once or twice a month. 
 
The thing is, I'm happy for them. I want them to find someone because I know it's what I want for me. We tried for nearly five years on and off and we hurt each other. I know I'm doing the right things though, not tying their value to their willingness to be with me. That was important to me, to try to remain friends. Real friends, not the kind that lurks in the wings waiting to see if something can be hammered into place to force love. It's just tough.

323,CasualConversation,I think I just had a bit of a mental breakthrough that’s been causing me so many problems.,"Idk how grand, if at all, this is, but lately I’ve been feeling serious anxiety that’s been holding me back, and keeping me from doing a lot of things. 

I’ve been sitting here in a hotel room for a couple hours now, just playing with my Rubik’s cube, and listening to random YouTube videos, and it all just sort of dawned on me. 

I’m not on a schedule. 

That was the thing that’s been almost mentally crippling me for years. 

Even now, as I’ve finally made the first part of a road trip I’ve been wanting to do for years, I’ve been feeling all anxious, and thinking about delays, and time, and all that. 

I had put myself on a mental schedule, and I was so terrified of missing all these make believe appointments I don’t even make that I’ve been holding myself back for years. 

All my life, I’ve been on some kind of schedule. Either school, or work, I always had these things that needed to be done, and a certain time they needed to be done in.

But I’m not on a schedule. 

Even if I break down, which is one of my fears, it’s okay. I have good car insurance, and I’ve been towed before, I know how to handle that situation.

I’m not rich, but I have enough money to make it, and good enough credit to go into a little debt if I have to, but it’s going to be okay. 

And it’s all going to be okay, because I have time now. I don’t have any appointments to make, at least right now. 

To be honest, I’m probably just going to go to bed soon, but I just feel… idk. I just feel relieved.

After that, he asked me out, and we had a great night. Since then, we've hung out a bunch, spending up to 12 hours at a time together, not realizing how long it has been at all. He's now my boyfriend. He makes me feel heard, understood, and he cares about me. He wants to listen to what I have to say, he supports me, and I support him, listen to him, and I am so excited to get to know him even more. I don't know how to describe it, because honestly we may just be in our honeymoon phase, but I feel at home when I talk to him. I know that he likes me for me, and not just my body and not my status (I'm literally a college freshman living in a dorm with a roommate, so that is not a concern of mine).

He gives me space when I need space, doesn't try to monopolize my time, and respects my boundaries. When I'm with him and my friends, he makes a point to try to get to know my friends and make sure that they are actively engaged in the conversation a nd not feeling like they are third wheeling. He is a put together human being, who doesn't rely on me to take care of him, but knows that if he ever needs anything, I am here for him. We have both been very open about our boundaries and have put a lot of effort into communication, though not much, if anything, has gone wrong yet. 

We are similar in a lot of ways, in terms of our struggles and motivations, but also have differences in interests, hobbies, and goals, so there is so much to learn from each other.

What his manager told him was: ""Sorry, you are from Malaysia, but Lunar New Year is a Chinese holiday"". So my friend had to reply a lengthy email explaning what is ""Chinese"" and the difference between nationality and race to his manager. Fortunately, he got his time off. 

Seems like there is still a confusion between Chinese as a race and as a nationality. 

There are actually many Chinese people around the world, and in Southeast Asian countries e.g. Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, they form a sizeable population. 

In Singapore and Malaysia, the local Chinese people are descendants of merchants, workers, miners, etc. of Chinese people who left China in the 19th century (either willingly or unwillingly impressed by the British), came to Southeast Asia, and settled here. 

We still keep our language, some of the customs and traditions, but there are quite some obvious differences between us and the Chinese people in China e.g. food, accent, vocabulary, way of life.",disillusioned_3725,1642048514

In my community, I don’t see anyone cool…especially, not the young people.  I don’t see cool on tv, which is weird.  TV is really weird, tried to watch it the other day and it was just weird.  Haven’t seen tv in years…and it was weird.  I’m not the intended audience.

371,CasualConversation,I have a serious question to ask my uncle. Should I ask him in person or send him a video?,"Hi guys!

My uncle at our Christmas party told me that there’s a position open at his university in his department for a project manager and that he’d love to hire me but I don’t have a bachelors or 10 years experience so he probably wouldn’t be able to hire me. He said that he’d be able to teach me everything on the job, though. 

Some backstory - uncle, rich as all get out. Me? 26 and can’t make it out of the rut of going to school, finishing a semester and taking a few off, working odd jobs, grew up with no dad, living with grandparents, etc. 

They say it’s all about who you know right? Well project management is something I’ve been interested in for awhile. I’m soon to be enrolled in a project management certificate backed by google that they consider the same as a bachelors. 

I’d like to make a case to my uncle, that this experience would change my life forever. Get me out of the money rut. I wanted to ask him to go fishing and get him a beer (never mind that I brought him 2 growlers of beer from Alaska that he didn’t appreciate) and ask him there, and sincerely, since he’s told me to ask him for help when I need it and I never have. 

But he’s going to be gone skiing in Montana and I just can’t wait anymore, part of me wants to make a video talking to the camera and send it to him. Part of me thinks I’ll be able to make my case better that way because he intimidates me with his confident rich guy aura. 

What do you think I should do? He’s said he wants to hire me.. he can teach me everything, and I’m in a certificate program. I also have a connection at google, and with the certification, her reference, and a few years as a project manager at the university I think I could have a good chance at being hired by google. 

Idk what to do. I’m scared he will say no even though I know it’s possible. It’s all about who you know?",RootlessBoots,1642038500

I've tried doing things to build my confidence and let go of the past like meditating, yoga, weightlifting, BJJ, etc. None of them have helped me

I've seen alot of posts on reddit from victims of past bullying saying their former bullies are now losers - homeless, in prison, working at mcdonalds, etc. Or those bullies felt bad about it and apologized years later

I've seen alot of people saying you have to forgive the bullies. I can forgive the ones who were bullying because they were failures themselves. But alot of my former bullies were not ""losers"". They were privileged in that they were tall, attractive to girls/women, outgoing, had lots of friends, got into prestigious universities and landed high-paying jobs. My brother is one example. How am I supposed to forgive them when not only did they completely get away with the bullying, but they have all the things I wish I had in life and have no idea about the torment I've had to suffer through? They have no idea what its like to be depressed, have no friends, be disrespected for being too softspoken, etc

386,CasualConversation,My dad is just... terrible at Halo.,"My dad grew up before the eras of video games (he's retiring this year), but he used to play with us when we were kids from time to time. Honestly looking back, video games were the only time he would just sit down and play with us. And Halo 1 (on the Mac) was one of the best games that we used to play over and over again.

Well now it's 2022, not 2002. Me and my dad call every single weekend, just to say hi, whether we've got news or we just talk about stupid stuff like telescopes and dumb jokes. Lately, he went out and got the Halo package deal thing on Steam- it lets us play online like we used to for years! Now we can verbally chat each other while shooting at each other. Except... It's just me. Killing him. A lot. I mean I am just wiping the floor with him, and he's doing his best.

I know what he really wants is to spend some time together in a way that feels more involved (I'm stationed a continent away), but these games are so one-sided. 

Yes, sometimes I goof off and miss so he can win a couple points in a round. Sometimes I just stop trying at all. 

Sometimes I try to teach him pointers to help him improve. He doesn't take them well.

But these maps are *empty,* between two people and two people only. And a lifetime later I still know where all the powerups are, it's crazy. I am a working adult too, now.

404,CasualConversation,I'm 24 and I still have no idea what to do for a career.,"I have a lot of vague interests and goals, but I guess I don't really know how to apply them. 

I want to help my community, and I want to educate people. I want to help homeless people in a way that's more than just giving them my change when I pass by, I want to make my city more accessible, I want to get involved in social justice movements.

I like helping to spread information--I like writing wiki pages and I like making rare or hard to find stuff accessible to the public, whether it be uploading obscure music to [archive.org](https://archive.org) or sharing abandonware files. I also like researching stuff--at one point I considered writing essays for money, since I've already attempted writing essays or news articles for fun.

I'm interested in environmental issues, but I don't think I'm smart enough to be a scientist--maybe I just haven't had it explained in a way that clicks, but I just don't \*get\* anything past basic precalc. So would that be better applied to volunteering, maybe working in a museum or simply cleaning up trash? Or something more on the artistic side like photography, since that's another thing I'm interested in.

I don't know which of these concepts would be best applied to a career, which to volunteer work, and which to leave as a hobby. I think the problem with considering a lot of non-freelance, non-self employed careers is the fact that I'm bad with motivation and deadlines. My m.o. is usually ""leave everything to the last minute and then rush it on the second to last day before it's due"" which obviously wouldn't work at a real job. I haven't really put too much thought into confirming this theory, but I think I do better at tasks that don't have a deadline, but are just immediate action jobs.

It's probably not coincidence that as more people are born on this planet and people become more comfortable being different that speaking and thinking in generalizations becomes less and less acceptable. What do you think the world is like when we can never generalize? Assuming the trend of it becoming less and less acceptable continues?

I did tho start doing stuff I like more and one of those things is fashion and self expression. I started painting my nails (much to my mom's dismay since I'm a guy and she is a little conservative) and being extra meticulous with what i wear and started just trying on different pieces of clothes to see what i like and what makes me feel like i look good.

409,CasualConversation,The gym has honestly changed my life,"This will probably sound like a pretty cliché story. I went through a pretty nasty breakup in late 2020. I spent the rest of 2020 and a good half of 2021 being sad. I had always had issues with self confidence and hated everything about myself, and that breakup made all of that worse. I had also always been very skinny (6'1"" 150lbs) and found myself down to 135lbs in May.

Finally in June I decided to do something about it. I started lifting a little with the equipment my family had in our basement. Soon after, I found that my local gym had a good deal on memberships for students. I signed up and went religiously. I began eating a lot and bulked up quickly with noob gains. I ended up gaining about 20lbs between then and now and got up to 155lbs. I have never felt better. I actually feel GOOD when I look in the mirror rather than being disgusted and embarrassed. My self confidence has skyrocketed. Obviously I am a little socially awkward still, but not nearly as bad as before. I actually feel good enough to go out of my way to talk to girls, when before I hadn't talked to any girl since my ex. And last but not least, I found a new hobby. In the past I hit the gym on and off for short periods of time. I would be too focused on looking for results and quit when I don't see them. Obviously I'm still looking for results, but I enjoy the actual lifting sessions now too. I genuinely enjoy going to the gym and striving to hit PR's. I love it.

I am so glad I started lifting. If it wasn't for the gym I would probably be in a pretty dark place right now.

tl;dr: Nasty breakup in late 2020. Was already skinny, lost even more weight in 2021. Started lifting in June, and bulked up. My self confidence has skyrocketed and I genuinely feel good when I look in the mirror. I enjoy going to the gym now more than the results of the gym",athrowaway142,1642020872

420,CasualConversation,"Learnt something rather interesting today, thought I might share","Vsauce obviously.
Did you know that if you randomly spread a pack of cards across a table, there is a massive chance that is the first time anyone has spread a pack of cards that way or arranged a set of 52 numbers that way (assuming jack, queen and king is 11, 12 and 13) ever. Truly ever.

The number of combinations there are is 52 × 51 × 50...1, or 52!. (Mathematically, ! means factorial, which does a similar action as the above). I think the real number was like over 8×10^(67). It doesnt seem like much, but its insanely bigger than anything you could imagine. To put it into perspective, here's the example he used:

First, set a timer to the value of 52!. Then, imagine standing on the equator. Now, every 1 billion years, take 1 step. Then wait another billion years, then take another. Once you've gone around the whole planet, take one drop out of the Pacific Ocean and set it aside. Repeat all of this. Once the Pacific Ocean is empty, refill it, and place one piece of paper next to you. Keep doing this: walking around the earth, emptying the pacific, and placing down the paper. Once the stack of paper has reached the Sun, clear it out, and start again. Repeat this entire thing 1000 times. Once you finish, you would have barely completed 1/3 of the timer.

This is truly crazy, and it always makes me smile thinking about it. If this confuses you, just watch the vsauce video. He explains it much better.",LemonyBoy07,1642016183

I was barely 18 and had already decided on doing computer engineering because computers are cool and i was smart enough. I knew it had a-lot of coding but I didn't mind sitting on a cool computer and create more cool things so I liked how it sounds but years later i am creating barely anything but bugs and serving capitalistic code. My first semester had only one programming course and the rest was mathematics and english and some really basic and easy concepts, i never really understood why it was that easy. So anyway, in my semester break i was bored and wanted to try and do something with all that coding stuff i got in my first semester. I only knew Java, sometimes i feel like still thats all i know. I knew how to print stuff, read and write to a file and some basic gui and buttons. And thats when i wrote my first program to track the movies i've watched and those i want to watch, a movie tracker that has already existed back then but i didn't dare google it, what the fuck is up with that for a smart kid it sure took me a long time to figure out that i can learn coding much faster. I didnt know what a database is but i figured i know how to write a file thats how i can save my data. I wrote the program to give me a list of movies it has and can add to that movie through an add button and a text box, it did it with writing and reading from a file. I was so happy that i figured out a way to save data after closing the application. And then all throughout the semester break and the summer i returned to that app and upgraded it a little. added images, moved to a real database, added a rating system, a sorting criteria, search-bar, and so on.

The other day I made some for my sister and she enjoyed them so much and said i should open a noodle bar.


This is how i usually make my noodles:

Ingredients:
1.) 1 pack of noodles (I use the Kellogg’s brand)
2.) black vinegar
3.) 3 bird’s eye chilli pickled in black vinegar
4.) 2 teaspoons of Himalayan rock salt.
5.) Cup of water

Preparation:
Add all the ingredients at once in a pot and let it cook till 90% of the water has evaporated. I don’t really measure how much vinegar i add, but it looks like 2 tablespoons. The amount of chilli is optional, i like hot food so 3 is fine for me, my sister likes 2 pieces of birds eye chilli.

It's always been just for me.     







       








I've been going through a lot recently. And so, I've turned to my own mind to tell stories that help me process things I'm going through. Only now I'm stuck on fictional characters that already exist! I have found a few characters out there that I relate to, and I find myself constantly imagining myself as them, adding to their stories to more neatly fit my own.

474,CasualConversation,Memory of the one time where I was better than the girl my parents compared me to,"I'll never forget 4th grade. Little me was 9 or 10 years old.
I had to participate in a sports competition organised by school, together with one other student - let's call her Ann, my father's employees daughter.

My parents always compared me to Ann. Ann had the best grades, she did sports in her free time training for stuff like this. I in comparison was pretty much untrained. 
No one else in the class wanted to do it though, so I got convinced to join cause I was the skinny one.

The competition day is a blurry mess in my memories. I recall a lot of students. I don't know how many there were joining, maybe 100 or less in my run. 
I remember getting pushed to the side by some try hard girls that seemed to do that a lot. I remember being out of breath after 200 meters. I remember being very anxious and nervous. But I pulled it through, didn't focus on the others but just myself.

On the last 100 meters, I sensed someone close behind me, trying to take over. A short look confirmed that it was Ann. In this moment, I pulled all my remaining strength together, running as fast as possible, just a bit further... just a bit further...... and finished the race just before her, as 10th place.

That day, admittedly, I felt good to be better than Ann for once. But whether it was enough for my parents or not - I can't remember. At least I was proud of myself.",Fareysia,1641994863

Again, I have come across so many people narrate something paranormal, yet if you ask them about their supernatural or paranormal, they'd out right reject the notion of its existence.

With so many experiential narratives available, I find it odd that paranormal studies are not seen as legitimate study. Of course, I understand and accept that there too many frauds out there...

499,CasualConversation,"I’m feeling really low recently, so I wrote this letter to myself as suggested by my therapist. I thought maybe it could resonate with someone else.","You are strong, radiant, resilient, and wise. Your intuition speaks louder than words, and I’m so proud of how far you’ve come in trusting your inner voice. The more you listen to your intuition the stronger it gets. You know your needs and boundaries and all it takes is speaking your truth to have them respected. I know you’re scared right now. I know your chest is full of anxiety and your throat feels tight. These emotions are uncomfortable and all you want is to push them down and pretend everything is okay. Remind yourself that its okay that everything isn’t okay right now. It’s okay not to be okay. But everything WILL be okay. Everything is unfolding in divine time. Even though it’s not the timeline you hoped for or expected. You know your needs. You need to sleep early every night and wake up before sunrise because it makes you feel like your best self, and you feel connected to your spirit and inner wisdom. When you do this you feel so connected to nature as well. It brightens your spirit. You feel more motivated to do the things you love and are passionate about. You need to eat a food that nourishes. Food is medicine, and when you fill your body with food that nourishes you, it fills you up not only physically, but also mentally, spiritually, and energetically. You can sense immediately when you consume things that don’t resonate with you. They drain you of your resources rather than filling you with them. Your body and brain suffer. Your spirit suffers. You need to exercise and feel your body move and become stronger. It’s like a meditation for you. It connects you to your physical body and takes you out of these patterns of overthinking. It improves your brain chemistry and mental health. It brings you joy and makes you feel like the powerful being that you are. It empowers you and fulfills you. It brings you strength and good health. It sustains you. It motivates you and improves your self image. You need routine. You have so many aspirations in life and you deserve to achieve your goals. You know that you can work hard and achieve anything you want to in life. Don’t allow anyone or anything to take that away from you or distract you from that. You know that there is more in this life than the state that you’re currently in. You know that there’s more to this life than a relationship or a job or one place on earth. There is endless opportunities to explore in this life. Never stop exploring the world, externally &amp; internally. 
I know that you have been so filled with self doubt recently and in the past. You really like this soul that has found his way into your life. Just remember how lucky they are that you have allowed them in. You are a goddess. You are a beautiful amazing being of light that is worthy of all the love in the world. Don’t forget to love yourself first. Because if you can fill up your own cup you will never ever EVER need someone else to fill it for you. Be aware of how you talk to yourself. Be aware of that self talk and how it makes you feel. Ask yourself, “would I talk to my best friend this way if she made a mistake?”. You must trust the process. Remember that you are guided. There is a plan for you. Everything is unfolding exactly how it’s supposed to. You can let go of control and just be. You don’t have to worry about the outcome because it’s going to happen exactly how it’s suppose to regardless of anything you do. You don’t have to hold it together. Let go of the tightness you feel. Surrender to the discomfort and pain and fear, for they are necessary components in the process of growing into the person that you are meant to be. Allow yourself to be anxious, it’s okay to be. Don’t be ashamed of it. You’re allowed to be sad if that’s how you feel right now. You’re allowed to be happy if that’s how you feel right now. You’re allowed to be in love, or scared, or angry. What matters is how you respond to those emotions. Observe them, and be curious about them. Take time for yourself whenever you need to. Your inner child deserves to be loved, and you are the only one that can provide that love. Fill up your own cup first, until it’s overflowing and you can’t help but share it with the world. The world needs more of that.",Semilanceatapsilocyb,1641976381

528,CasualConversation,My little yorkshire terrier will be euthanized this or next week.,"Hello.  


My little yorkshire terrier will be euthanized this or next week. Last month he had his first seizure.  
I thought everything is okay, it was only a short seizure. A day later again. Another day later again. A week later twice. The third week 3 more.   


After the first seizure I already went to the vet, she gave us meds for him but cause of his weight it is hard to find a good dose. He got 1/8 of that med in the morning and late afternoon. It didnt help.  
We went back. Diagnosed brain tumor.  


Currently he can walk a bit, sometimes he can't even stand. He is totally confused. If I call him he walks towards me in circles, sometimes walks the wrong direction, against a wall, corner, furniture.   
I have to hold him when he pees or poops because he just falls down and can't keep balance.   
I feed him. Now he can't even eat out of the bowl so I form little balls out of the food and give him the balls. It takes about 1 hour for that small portion of food.  


I am so sad. I had hard times with my yorkshire terrier. When he was mad he just looked at me and started to pee on my carpet, he always ran in circles on my bed at 4 in the morning when he wanted to pee and woke me up the last 6 years nearly every day.  
I literally sometimes could have just turn his neck around lol. But I obviously never did.  


He was and is my best friend and I hope he won't have a seizure until I go to the vet this or next week and put him to rest. This is so hard for me because I can't even tell him why he is dizzy, why he can't stand or eat, why he keeps peeing himself. He is just confused and I think he knows it is the end.

I get motion sickness and I thought it was pretty normal as I notice a lot of people have the same problem. I also sort of noticed it when I can't answer questions of things that I know if it's brought up unprompted, I don't mean in an ambush interview-style just part of a conversation. I thought maybe I just have performance anxiety so I left it. One of the other ones is when I watch sports on TV (mainly soccer) whenever a play is especially fast I have no idea what's going on until watching it a few times. Or I have a hard time with the whole 3d map thing, where the angle of the camera makes it seem like players are closer than they actually are.

I have also been looking for a new challenge that will fulfill me ( I am currently a wedding photographer and don't find that fulfilling anymore) anyway, I am still really afraid of just putting content that is super personal to me out there, but i know this is rooted on a fear of ""what will people think of me"" but I'm trying to ignore that fear and just move forward with a plan without tying so many of my emotions to the content.",sinmiedo24,1641953535

557,CasualConversation,Feeling sad from constantly getting yelled at. Anyone have any subreddits to distract me?,"Recently got a new puppy. She peed on the carpet because she was sleeping, woke up when he came home, and ran past me into the family room when I opened the gate to go say hi to him. He got mad because I wasn’t being mean enough to her. 
Then I just took her outside to go to the bathroom a couple minutes ago after she was in her crate for a little over an hour. He got really mad because “It hasn’t been 2 hours” and “now she’s gonna have to pee every hour and I’m gonna have to take her out” and other stuff. He keeps saying that “I should be apologizing to her because now she has to do crate training for another couple days” which is where she can only come out of her crate if we’re watching her, and then she goes back in. By the way, he’s been leaving her alone upstairs while he works in the basement and she’s peed on the floor pretty much every day. 
I don’t know. He’s probably right about a lot of this stuff, but *he* wanted to get the dog. It was the same week we lost our old dog. Same breed, also came from a farm. Felt too much like replacing our old dog to me, but he was buying it so it wasn’t my choice. Now all my free time is spent taking the dog out and playing with her constantly for hours, and when she gets older I’ll be expected to take her on more than one walk every day after school and also training her to fit my dad’s needs (running companion), but if I’m not strict enough, he’ll step in and yell at her for no reason, and then immediately give her way too much freedom so she gets confused and stressed. I go to school every day, and he’s only home after 7 on weekdays. It makes no sense. 

I don’t really want to talk about it at all. I kind of just wanted to vent. I’m crying in my room right now because I’m really mad and annoyed and feel like I’m failing my dog.

In general I don't think i've really acknowledged how much this has bothered me over the past couple years to not be able to connect and interact with the general public by simple facial cues and expressions.

590,CasualConversation,My biology sir has some kind of hatred against me,"It's been a month since this happened but I just can't stop feeling embarrassed about this. 

So when our physical college classes started then on my 3rd day in biology class during a lecture I was practising some diagrams in my notebook during the lecture. Then just for about hardly 2 seconds, I started thinking about something else and in those 2 seconds, my eyes were pointing towards the girl's table. Now let me tell you how the bio class is arranged. So because of covid, we do not take bio class in regular classrooms because there are a lot of bio students so we take bio class in lab . in the lab there are 2 very long tables parallel to each other and so one is for us boys and the other is for girls and the tables have cabinets in them where all equipment is stored so like while sitting on a chair only our above body part is visible, not the legs. So during biology class when for roughly 2 seconds I was not paying attention to the lecture but thinking something else while looking at the table on the girls side my biology sir saw me and said ""I know you are looking at girls again and again"" but I thought that sir might have said this to my friends who were sitting on my left side and I ignored it and started doing my work on my notebook. But then my friend sitting right next to me said to sir that he wasn't looking. But then sir said ""the one who was looking knows that he was"" and I don't need to point him out now. I was still not paying attention to his words and just doing my work when my friend again said but sir it wasn't me. Then sir said, ""You want me to point it out?"" And my friend answered ""Yes"". At that time  I looked towards the whiteboard where sir wrote the lecture and I shooked my head up to down two times. Now sir was standing near the whiteboard and looking towards me but I didn't know if he was looking towards me or my friend. Now sir said, ""the one who was looking on girls, again and again, accepted it and now I don't have to point it out"". now when I looked towards the board and shooked my head two times it was because I couldn't understand what I read in the book and the definition that sir wrote on the board was much easier to understand so I shook my head up and down because I understood what that meant but sir thought that I accepted my mistake and I don't want him to point it out. At that time more than half of the class was looking at me (about 20 students) and I had no idea what just happened and was just doing my work on my notebook. Then sir resumed the lecture and after five minutes the class ended. Now I was leaving for my next chemistry class when I just had eye contact with sir and he stared at me with an angry face. Like his expressions were telling that he hates me. When I left the class then 2 of my friends came running to me asking ""Dude why were you looking at the girls the whole time"" and I was like WHAT when did that happen??? Then they explained to me everything that how sir pointed me out and how I shooked my head accepting my mistake and how everyone was looking at me and I was just doing my work. I explained to them that I didn't even know when that happened and they felt surprised that you just got embarrassed in front of the whole class and you didn't even know. I was like no how did what happen?? When did this happen??
Now I think that all the girls would be thinking that I am a stalker or something and I keep on looking at them :( 
It was my third day at college and sir ruined my whole year in college already :(

He just doesn't like me. Once my mom met him in college when she came to pay for my college fees. My biology sir told her that I am not a good student and I don't pay much attention to lectures. I don't learn tests properly and I am failing most of my tests. Idk why he said that but everything he told to my mom was a lie and I can't believe it. 

During biology class whenever I ask sir to explain something or repeat something for me he just doesn't want to repeat anything for me. His response is always the same which is ""pay attention towards the lecture I don't have time to explain one thing again and again"" but whenever someone else asks a small question he/she gets his answer no matter how dumb the question is. Once my friend who has good relations with sir asked a question which related to a topic which was explained around 3 days ago but sir explained that whole topic briefly in around 5 minutes and continued the lecture. Why does he not only want to answer my question? 

Why do such teachers even exist :( 

I don't feel like taking biology class anymore and only if I could bunk bio class and instead learn something else and prepare bio on my own at home from youtube and other websites. I just hate my biology sir now. But I never responded to him in a bad manner or anything and whenever he said anything bad to me I just accepted it and kept quiet because I don't want to make a fight scene with him and I still respect him but he just wants me to yell at him so he can report my behaviour to my parents somehow.

596,CasualConversation,Anyone relate to this?,"I know in my heart that to find the right person for me, I just need to wait. Wait until the time is right and chance lets us meet. And yet, it’s so hard to stop myself from trying to search for them. I’ll explain why.

A bit about me: I’m not conventionally romantic, however I’m straight. What I mean by this is that I can’t “get into” people or have crushes on people in any true way. I could only ever learn to love someone if I’d developed an emotional/personal connection with them already. And even then, I’m not sure that would happen. I just don’t experience it the same way others do.

But because of the way that I am, I can’t date people. Because I just simply wouldn’t be able to romantically love them. I’m not going to be stupid enough to go to a date and try to rile up my emotions or convince myself I’m into someone when I’m not, because then I’ll just be allowing them a chance to open up to me, before leaving them, which would inevitably happen. 

To me, I could only truly fall in love with someone who is the right person for me. Someone who shares my values, and is the right person in a way that I can’t explain. I don’t know if that person exists, because I’ve never found a person who I really wanted to get to know in that way. To me it would be a friendship before anything else, and I wouldn’t really categorize it between barriers. Romance could definitely be a part of it, but only if it happened naturally, and just as a way to be close or express affection in some way or other.

So in the end, my loneliness causes me to try to talk to people online and stuff, but I always come out of it feeling empty. Because I know I’m not really going to feel for them in that way. On top of that, I’m pretty cautious to do that anyways, because it would be easy for someone else to start “getting into me” in the normal way and I wouldn’t be able to reciprocate those feelings.",unknownhuman25,1641935200

Anyone else?","So im typically an anxious person, sometimes i have ""gut feelings"" or more accurately , scary ""what if"" intrusive thoughts and usually they are never right at all, but the past 3 days they have been and its putting me on edge

Day 1: My brother told us that he was going to be moving to a different house a while ago and i instantly have this thought ""hes definitely going to drag covid in on his family"" but it was just a gut feeling and i couldve been completely wrong, well 3 days ago he called us and told us in the most tired voice ive ever heard that him and his wife are extremely sick and he is positive for covid and that he hasnt been able to sleep because of how bad his breathing has gotten,  damn.

Day 2: I had put my computer down and i had an instant thought of ""its going to fall and break"" but i brushed it off because there was no way for it to fall, it was layin flat on a flat surface, the moment i turned my back and walked away i heard a loud thump, it feel and everything shattered, but how did it fall? i think some how my cat mightve been the culprit, the same day it was raining really hard and for some reason i thought that maybe the ceiling would leak but we have never had a leak so i found a bucket and put it where i would remeber where it was, sure enough that night water started dripping in the middle of the ceiling onto the floor, luckly i was quickly prepared

Day 3: (this had the most gut feelings and ALL of them were right, I got up to do laundry but as i was putting it in i had this thought ""something is going to cause a power outage so it wont work"" i brushed it off 100% because like how could someone even predict that right? there was no snow or anything to cause it but sure enough a few minutes after i started it everything went out, every house around us went black and the next second we all heard a huge boom, turns out the fuse blew and at the same time some guy hit the poll, so they had to fix both poles,  usually in the past places i lived it took days for it to be fixed cuz our company was shit, but for some reason i just knew it would be back within probably 2 hours, and IT WAS   this isnt even insane but its cool! i feel like a super hero,  also

the same day my mom made some food for her and i had the thought ""thats definitely going to give her some trouble""  and she choked on it and almost couldnt breathe i was so freaked out omg not only that, she felt really bad after eating it, am i some super human?? lmao fr tho this is a weird 3 day long coincidence

618,CasualConversation,Friend keeps hanging out with a guy who did and does both of us wrong behind my back,"Sorry in advance for rambling quite a bit. 

This is a guy that I talked about in another post before. He confessed that he had a crush on me about a month ago, then got weirdly possessive over me (especially when I was near my guy friends), kept begging me to hang out even though I had declined several times before, argued with me about the fact that I always ""complain"" about something and recently stopped texting me at all. A few other notable instances: he manipulated me by talking about a different girl every day to make himself look desireable, told me no one will ever like me cause I'm weird and too childish for a bf, sent me a girl's self harm picture ""as a joke"" and went into panic mode shortly after I blocked him (then started holding a grudge while he begged my friends to tell me to unblock him and telling them of all the sleepless nights he spent thinking about me). In a word he's a psychopath. This is most of what he did to me, and my friend knows how hard this hit me because I would text her to get stuff off my chest while I was literally in tears. She said she agreed with me, that he's toxic and horrible and blah blah blah.

Side note: before he confessed to me he kinda tried to hit on her and they hung out a couple times. He later completely ghosted her and ignored her for me. She was very hurt by this and I consoled her like she did for me and we talked about how shitty his behaviour was at length. But now that he drops me she is suddenly all eyes and ears for him like????? Talking about how she ""feels like she needs male presences in her life rn even just as friends""??? When she ranted for hours about how she couldnt believe he was this toxic to me and how ""she doesnt want to get involved""??? She deadass says she is just trying to be polite because ""she can't just say no like I do"". I cant even get a word in with her because he's with her all the damn time. Worst thing is they hang out behind my back and she doesnt even mention it. Like I know it's her life and her choices but if the roles were reversed I would at the very least inform her (actually I wouldnt hang out with a guy who treated my friend in such a shitty way at all). Idk, I thought she was the nicest and sweetest person ever...now I'm starting to doubt that. I really thought I could trust her. I've never felt more alone.",whocaresanyway_,1641927593

620,CasualConversation,I learned a new alphabet in a week and I am proud of myself!,"Well, as the title says, I started learning a new alphabet last week. The alphabet is called Solitreo and it's a very old branch of Hebrew script used to write Ladino, also known as Djudeo-Espanyol. It is the language my family spoke for 500 years after fleeing Spain in the Spanish Inquisition, until they got to America. It is mostly Spanish, and follows Spanish grammar patterns, but occasionally includes a word from Turkish, Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew. I first had to learn the Hebrew alphabet (thanks quizlet), then Rashi, a form of the Hebrew alphabet used to write non Hebrew languages (such as Judeo-Spanish and Judeo-Arabic), and then I found a handy chart with the Solitreo letters written, copied them down, and started writing stuff! I practiced reading with my great grandma's journal, and was able to read it, albeit slowly. I am now able to write as well, which is pretty cool considering it could literally be used as a secret code with how few people know it. It was just such a cool feeling to be able to learn that quickly and on top of that put my new knowledge into practice with a text that is important to my family. I feel a little weird bragging about having some new almost useless skill but still. Feels good. 

If you can read Hebrew, imagine this but written in scribbles (it's Spanish-ish)(I don't know a word of Hebrew though only the letters):

נואיבה לאינגוה סאיקראיטה! מי פלאזי ראקי :)

642,CasualConversation,Went to the dentist for the first time in 30 years yesterday and it was amazing,"To start both of my parents had dental issues when I was growing up, and my mom always told me to brush two times a day since I can recall. But did I do that? Absolutely not.

As I grew older I started brushing every day twice but like 30 seconds a time. So my teeth though white became yellowish. And I stopped smiling in pictures with teeth in them.

During the first lockdown in 2020, I matched with a girl on a dating website and added her on my Instagram. One day she asked me if she didn't see my teeth in any of my pictures, and do I have bad teeth? This made me really conscious of my teeth. I started flossing, bought an electric brush, and spent 2-3 minutes every time I brushed. Also taking into account my parent's dental history, I was always thinking someday I will have some dental issues.

I was a bit scared, but on New years I decided to book myself a dental appointment. To face whatever bad news might come. I went to the dentist, and he checked my teeth, and said, I have very strong and good teeth, and he kind of cleaned them. And now my teeth look a bit whiter.

Anyway, I never finished it because the dream kind of changed to me being scared of a spider on something I wanted to grab (it went on me 😞), but then I woke up from a mental alarm to put on the dryer. It was already done, which was nice, but then I remembered that I had just woken up from a dream, and my disappointment was so great that I suddenly felt awake after feeling very tired a moment before.

653,CasualConversation,"Not gonna lie, it's sometimes tiring being an Indian.","Hey lovely people, this is just going to be a post pouring my heart about stuff I have kept inside me since long, in no way is it a professional, well written or anything complex.. its just a vomit of words. 


Sometimes, i wish I wasn't born in this country. Other times, I am filled with pride at how much my country has given to the world. It's a love-hate relationship, basically. When I look at countries like Japan or south korea, i feel extremely upset and jealous that my country, is lagging behind in so many factors. Be it basic civil sense, or the development, or poverty or anything else, we are really behind compared to other countries. Japan was affected by the horrible incident in 1945, South korea was colonized by Japan and was one of the poorest countries in the world, Singapore as well but all of these countries bounced back, really really hard. I wonder what went wrong with us.. 

I was on Omegle the other day, looking to talk to people and stuff. A teenager comes up (think she was from the US, idk) and asks me where I'm from, i reply to her saying I'm from India, she says

*Oh god*... Then skips me

In not upset at being skipped, really. Because of some creepy, attention deprived, sexually repressed moronic simps from country i had to face this. Not gonna lie, i get why she skipped me and i get why people would feel grossed out by something's the people of my country do.. but it still hurts.

There was a video comparing Japan and India's rivers and boy did you have to see the comments.. I'm not gonna include them here, you can read them yourselves.. The baffling thing is, there was a similar video about dirty rivers in the Phillipines but damn do i remember the comments being so much more nicer. Compared to the one i saw, i sure didn't see comments saying that the Phillipines should be nuked, they don't deserve to exist, shithole, poo in the loo, pajeet stereotypes, toilet of the world etc etc..

Guys, we know. We know that india has problems. We know that our country isn't no where near any of the above mentioned countries. But here's one thing.

We don't need it shoved down out throats time and again. Sure, a lot of people in India are very stubborn and don't listen until you kick their asses a few times. I don't see why the world hates us so much. Then again i somewhat do understand, maybe I don't. 

That's all folks, i have spoken what i wanted to.

655,CasualConversation,Taking a shit right now and just realized school is stupid,"I haven't gone to school for a month and a half because of Covid and stuff but during my off time I was watching anime and the characters were expressing their hatred for studying and I realized that studying is stupid. The point of a teachers job is to teach us the material why would we need to learn it ourselves? You couldnt even call it learning it is more of a memory game and the person with the best memory wins. It doesn't make much sense. My schools don't really believe in homework or studying so we rarely do that, thankfully, but I feel bad for people who have to go through that. I don't think I have ever really studied unless you count practicing my times tables one time, but even with that I have had good grades up until highschool which is now. When teachers teach us they give us a process to the subject and stuff like that but if we our studying than unless we are given a specific book or instructions we cant really do that on our own.",BlitzingPlatinum,1641913002

I've always kept a keen eye over environmental issues. Ozone hole, bees collapse, draughts ... But everything seemed so *far away* for a long time, up until the Pandemic stroke. 

Not to mention, now I have kids. It's for them that I fear the most. What kind of world will they live in? Should I prepare them to some kind of degree? Have them study some field in particular that could help them better in a potential societal collapse?  

Then the movie hit me hard. I now see the climate issue as a real danger and I dont see anything going on as a big movement. They say the economy has to change but most of the people I see around me dont really care or think its just a hoax. 

And so, a question keeps hovering in my mind ... Is humanity doomed? Should I take some steps, like, buying a home on some mountain? Take precautions by building a shelter? Have survival lessons?

696,CasualConversation,"5 years ago, I only had 2 friends. Now, I (19F) want to invite 30 friends to my birthday.","I thought I lacked the social finesse to befriend other people in my cohort. There were nights where I would cry, half-pitying myself for being so lonely and half-angry at classmates. Though they wouldn’t say it to my face, their constant actions of exclusion and occasional words said behind my back really hurt me. During those nights, my mom would hug me while we were lying in her bed together, and she would tell me, “in this water full of goldfish, you’re a koi. Nobody is wrong here – you’re just not in the right pond. Be patient. You will find your circle of people.” 

But in that narrow world of high school, it was hard for me to believe her words. I thought I was just bad at socializing. I thought I was just an introvert. I thought I was too much, too hard to love. 

I’m currently abroad for university. I’m lucky I have supportive parents who have the financial means to send me here. Going from a developing country to a developed one, all I promised to myself was, “I will build a life here.” 

Then, people slowly trickled into my life. I spent the first semester reminiscing my tight-knit, amazing friendship group in high school (yes, I managed to find five lifelong friends there). Then, I entered a group chat. Then another. Then I joined a club. Then a friend introduced me to their friend. Then I made a new club with that mutual friend. Then I randomly chatted with a person from my university’s confessions/love letter page's comment section. 

I don’t know whether it’s because I try my best to assume the best in people, or because I’m just lucky I’ve come across mostly good people. Whether I’m just afraid of loneliness or because I subconsciously just want to make more friends.

Suddenly, I have a network of support system consisting of about 4 different friendship groups and 30+ people. Now, I find it so easy to fall into a conversation with different people (my oversharing nature has helped a lot to make people open up to me, I guess). Heck, I even made a new friend in the Covid-19 testing line! We exchanged phone numbers and all that. 

Suddenly, people would refer to me as the “socializing queen”. My flatmate would say I’m one of her most sociable friends, with my phone going ding ding ding so often with the numerous friendship group chats I’m in. I want to host my 20th birthday party, but I’m in a joyful dilemma because I want to celebrate my birthday with 30 beloved friends and restrictions may not allow that. 

I don’t know, I just recently had this realization of how my social life has changed so much. But it’s such a mix of emotions. I’m afraid that one day, they would find a part of me that’s too much, too hard to love, and this all would be gone. 

I don’t know, I just want to share this mixture of emotions that has been popping up inside of me. I feel overwhelmed with love for my friends that I want to platonically kiss every one of their cheeks; I feel so proud of my wide circle of friends that I want to keep showing it off at every convo; but I feel so scared that I just want to cry alone under my blanket!",paper02crane,1641888033

However, I took my F like a man, shook my professor’s hand, and vowed to return. During my break I earned my driver’s license and got some of my confidence back. When the new semester began I was taken aback at how much I recalled and was able to put to use in class. I knew the stakes and the hard work necessary to pull off my goal. As the semester progressed I felt my hard work paying off and I eventually sat down taking my course final exam. Placing my hand on the submit button on my computer screen was the most stress inducing feeling I had in a long time, but unlike my first attempt, this time I was greeted with a message that I passed. Now I was to take my state practical and state written exam. Another pass later and I wounded up preparing with my partner for the final exam.

I was smoking a cigarette, and a young girl asked if she can bum one. I gave her one, and we started talking about some random stuff. I could immediately tell that she was under the influence of some drug, and she did say it herself too. She said that she had been addicted to whatever pills for around a year. She got my snapchat, i gave her some water from my apartment, and i started giving her advice on how to do stuff like apply to a school, and how to get ''KELA'' financial support and housing support. I told her that she cannot keep living like this, and no matter how fun it might seem, its not a good way to live your life. I also told her that she should get professional help to get sober. We said goodbyes and i didnt hear from her for awhile.

Well, a few months ago she sent me a snapchat message. She said that she has been 3 months sober, getting education and living in her own apartment. I told her that i am truly proud of her. She has plans for her future, and is living fine on her own. She keeps sending me thank yous every once in a while.

When the pandemic began, we decided to fix our place because we know we’ll spend all our time here. We threw away our old second-hand furniture and bought quality ones. We got rid of stuff we haven’t used for a year and decluttered our rooms.

Now, the things in our house are the things we actually use. We’ve made our living are and bedroom as comfy as possible, almost hotel-like but much cozier. So we don’t really feel the need to seek out joy outside our home anymore.

We walk to get stuff we need, we stay indoors for movie nights, we try new recipes of food we crave, we stopped feeling guilty when we do nothing but relax.

715,CasualConversation,A huge change in my life is just an email away.,"It's such a weird feeling. I got back into school. As easily as I can type this post and hit the post button, I can commit to a drastic change in my life. I'd quit my job, move halfway across the country, leave behind my stable, low stress life for the life of a graduate student. I haven't told anybody I know yet either. They know I applied, for months now, but not that I've gotten in. 

This was always part of the plan, though the plan took a little longer than I'd planned, as they do. Up until now it's always been in somebody else's hands to some extent, or so far away. But now that the decision is purely under my control, it's just the strangest thing. I cannot help but think of all the things I'll leave behind or see what I'm walking away from. I can't stop feeling like the song is writing me, so to speak. I guess I'm fine with that but damn is it a little frightening. Any yet every day I wake up wondering what I'm doing here, other than waiting till they ship my job off to China and fire me. This is my chance to compose.  

You all must have stories like this. Two paths: to stay on the well defined route you currently walk, or make a turn and hope that the hand drawn map your amateur cartography has cobbled together is halfway decent. And yes that's a potentially poorly executed music reference, if you get it than we probably have similar music tastes. Hooray. 

What'd you do though, and how'd it work out? Negative experiences are fine, since unless you fuck up real bad those are just chances to learn something about yourself the hard way, I suppose.

727,CasualConversation,What's your take on the following situation and your 2 cents in terms of improvement?,"The story:
I'm a student and live in a student dorm and one of my classmates (lets call  A) also live in the same building as me. We had conversation today and in that she told me lot of negatives about myself:

Scenario 1:
We're talking about connection with people and making friends and i said i don't really trust people so early so much (just the basic trust but not too much), i do take time to bond with people. So A tells me that this is not how connections are made, if you don't trust people, how you'll make connection and all other things. A also told me you need to invest in them, need to care for them early on to make good connection and A said that's why you don't have much connection with people here (here as in the  country i have shifted to for education purpose).
For record, yes i don't have much connection that i can lable as friends i know everyone from my batch pretty much on basic level and only have 1 proper mate whom i will call a friend.

Scenario 2: Then our conversation diverted to other topic. We had a friend ( lets call the name B)over at my place along with A and when B asked since me and A lives in the same appartment, do we cook together? So i simply said no, i don't have that much time which was in polite and good tone. Nothing to insulting or that sort. Also on NYE, i didn't have any specific plan, so at like 9 or 9.30 PM ish, I called A and asked whether A wants to hangout, maybe watch some movie. A said yes, i was cooking at that time. A comes at 10 and i asked her if A wants a cola or not. Even on A's refusal, I gave some. I finished cooking and we listened to some music and i had my meal. Since i cooked chicken and A being vegetarian, i didn't ask A whether she will eat or not as it was already 10 PM when she arrived. So i didn't ask about eating and assumed she must have eaten. We saw a movie which i suggested (i asked earlier if A wanted to suggest any and then when took time, i put up mine) A never attentively saw movie, scrolling the phone the whole time and went back home once it finished. 
When today A mentioned this, A said: ""although she had eaten her dinner, i didn't even ask as normal courtesy. 
Maybe that's why you (me) dont have good connections here""

Since all are relatively new people, met frist time or second at most (except for A), i don't want to meet usually at home as cooking for 3 or more is really time consuming and puts my resources and balance out of shape. If my close friends come over at my place, this will not be an issue.

1)So from my fellow redditers' perspective, in scenario 1 and 2 what i have done wrong?

2)What i could improve in both scenarios?

3) Also from the post, does it seem that I'm reserved person and don't put much efforts and have less less friends? Also i didn't proactively ask for lunc/dinner when someone comes at my place, mostly on 1st visit, am i being a terrible person who lacks normal courtesy or etiquettes?

(Tbh, i never had a good group, i had it only during graduation from Uni and everywhere i have been, i only had 2-3 good friends who are very good friends of mine esp i have 4-5 very well bonded friends from uni and we all were sort of a group as some of those friends also had groups with other classmates of mine. Now in my post graduation, i do have 1 good friend from my class and others are just okayish contact wise.)

It would we valuable to know your perspective and get the other side of view. Looking forward to your answers.",sanark13,1641869573

735,CasualConversation,I figured out my “Senior Project.”,"One of my favorite pieces of theater I’ve seen is the end of Bo Burnham’s “what.” special. The grand finale of the show is a piece called “We Think We Know You,” a piece about people and their 
expectations/thoughts about you.

As the piece progresses, the voices get louder until we get them all saying, “We Think We Know You.” To drown them out, Bo plays music, eventually incorporating their opinions into the music.

I mean, should comedy writers be judged for making ignorant jokes at a time when everyone else was making the same ignorant jokes.

Also, how do we evaluate the 'great' men of history, who were really just mass murderers. I mean people revere Alexander the Great, for 'conquering the world before he was 30', but in reality we are basically just saying 'Look how efficiently this guy murdered people before he was 30!'

I'm also excited to meet her boyfriend cause he's also a pretty cool dude and works in a company I really admire and maybe one day would like to work for too, so I guess it's gonna be pretty fun. She's also bringing a chess set so we can play like we began doing during the first few months of the pandemic (although we haven't done it in a while). 

We'll go to a restaurant to order food and have some beers, but since this is my first time going out to meet a friend since the start of the pandemic (I got doubled jabbed and ended the semester right before Christmas) I'm a little bit worried that I won't have a lot to talk about. That's why I've come to the help of this great community to ask for a little help in making our meeting more fun!

* What stuff should I bring for our meeting? Is just a smile enough or do you think that I should bring them a present (like baking something)?
* What should I do if I feel the conversation dragging a bit? Should I be upfront that my social gears are a bit rusty or just keep pushing new topics to see if they gain traction? Am I going to disappoint them if this time we just don't sync even if all our phone conversations were really good?
* At last, should I be this worried? As I said, the last time I really went out with anyone was 2 years ago, and I've never been too socially savvy though I could hold awesome conversations and have a good time. What should my mindset be going into meeting tomorrow?

Thanks for reading and helping me out! I'll update how it all went down tomorrow and hopefully bring some good stories. Cheers everyone!",TheBlueFighter,1641862053

I'm not very athletic and not while I'm a sports fan, I'm not interested in playing any. I'm not capable of walking for long periods, or of running at all really.

I know wheelchair sports exist, but I have a... complicated relationship with wheelchairs. Basically, they're out.

My girlfriend plays on a field hockey team and really enjoys it. Lately I've found myself craving certain aspects of being part of a team and trying to win stuff, score points and see your stats and stuff and try to improve. It sounds utterly pathetic when I write it like that, but it's a thing... I guess I just want to feel wanted/needed and involved in something outside of a relationship or work environment.

Does anyone have any ideas for a competitive hobby that involves being on a team but doesn't involve running/intense exercise?

755,CasualConversation,"Today was my birthday and it was going pretty crappy from the start, then my wife shocked me.","So I woke up at 145 this morning, but didn’t have to be up until 330 am. Couldn’t fall back asleep, so I gave up and played on Reddit til 3.

After getting ready for work, I saw a note from my wife wishing me a happy birthday and some slices of banana bread. Was the best part of the day til I got home from work.

As a garbage man, someone used my truck. They didn’t empty the load from when they used it, moved a bunch of my stuff, left trash inside the cab, and for some reason decided to take the driver door seal off and chucked it in the passenger seat. I live in Minnesota, so the temperature was -20s until 10 am or so. I was incredibly cold all day, and the route was just terrible. 

I was incredibly over today and wanted to just go to bed when I got home. My wife and kids greeted me, and wished me a happy birthday. Then my wife told me to open my present.

This wonderful, incredible woman bought me a PS5! I’ve been wanting this thing forever but they’re so expensive. I told her we can’t afford it, and she said she saved up for a while and was able to get one. I’m still shocked. This became one of the best birthdays ever.

As a person who ALWAYS has to have a bottle of water on me at all times, it baffles me. I have asked her so many times, like why do you do this, and she just has always said she is literally never thirsty so she just forgets about it completely. Example: Saturday night I realized she hadn’t had ANYTHING to drink. All day. So I was like “have you drank any water today?” She hadn’t. She had zero fluids whatsoever for the entire day.

770,CasualConversation,Should I leave the military?,"Hello all,

I come from a very military family, both parents, grandfather's and all of my great grandfather's except one all served. I have served just over six years myself. 

When I joined I had all the enthusiasm and energy in the world, I smashed just over a year of training with distinction before graduating as an engineer and entering full time service. Training was the highlight of my career. The commaradore and shared hardship made me some great friends and good memories and I had high hopes and energy for the future.

Since then however I have struggled. From day one the military was not what I expected when I arrived on my first unit. Others didn't share my enthusiasm, which is totally fine, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but i was actively mocked for my keenness. It seemed to me being proud of being in the military and coming from a military background was something to be embarrassed about and I was downtrodden. From there it almost always went downhill.

I always assumed I would be a ""lifer."" Smash out a full 20+ year tour like my dad did, leave with a healthy pension and maybe a medal or two. But six years on, having worked on multiple units, working on several different types of equipment and almost a years worth of time spent away on operations all over the world, I have become disheartened, and fallen totally out of love with it.

 I'm racking my brains trying to decide what to do about my future and would appreciate any opinions.

That being said, I'd love to know what the average person scrolling reddit might think of this.

Many thanks.",TomSaunders94,1641851671

Workout, eat well, buy/dress only in clothes you love/look great on you and get rid of clothes that are just “ok” so you look good every day, make realistic plans to get what you want out of life because you can, but do it for you so you can live your best life, you only live once

Either I can go back to the school I went to in 2021 or join a new one and make sure I don't have to face traumas from the last year. Till last year, I hadn't met a lot of people. I used to be busy with my books, my phone and my studies. But I had no option but to join a school+extra tuition to crack my entrance which is in 2023, so I joined one close to my place and it became a hell for me. Initially, I was overwhelmed with the amount of work I had to do but that was better than what was to come. A guy (let's call him John) liked a girl (let's call her Tammy) but Tammy told John that she liked me so John tried to remove me from her life and when he straight up asked me, I agreed to move away. But later, they broke up and she told him she still loves me....and I just talked to both of them and John said, ""She dumped me for you"". Nothing happened for quite some time but then after ignoring Tammy for quite some months, we talked and sorted out things. Now, she had found out all the heinous shit John had done viz. spreading rumours about people, creating fake chats to support his claims and at times even creating fake accounts, etc. I didn't believe her at first but then John's close friend Celim told me about how he got his new gf (Casey) after removing her bf (now ex) from the equation. John pretended to be Casey's older cousin and texted the bf from a fake account, he later also called him by hiding his caller ID. When none of this worked, he made fake chats of the bf saying something wrong about Casey and showed them to her through another fake account with which he pretended to be the bf's friend. All this to get a girl.
Back to Tammy.....she gave John a pack of Dog Food on his birthday in front of the whole class for his actions. He was agitated ofc and ended up causing problems for her and everyone associated to her. When none of it worked, he made a fake account of her, uploading her pics and putting slutty captions. Her friends (including me) received requests from that account. I am just worried all the time that he causes me some problems, he might accuse me of making that fake account or spread some fake shit about me like he did with so many others. He is a psychopath.
I just can't believe people can stoop so low for revenge.

844,CasualConversation,I feel like I’ll never be able to have my own life and will always have to live with my mom… and I feel guilty about feeling this way.,"It has always been my mom and I. She has done so much for me and has gone through a lot. I don’t know my father and want no relationship with him. My mother never remarried because she said she was too scared to bring a man into her life and perhaps have him not be great towards me. 

Before two years ago, my desire was that once my mom retired she would go back to her home country where some of her siblings live. She owns a home there and my thoughts were that she could come here where we live whenever she wanted to visit but that her home country would now be where she lives. I was excited at the thought that I would be able to make my own life as an adult. 

However, two years ago we found out that my aunt had been stealing a lot of money from my mother over the years and that my grandmother knew about this and kept quiet. My mom was so traumatized by this that she had to start going to therapy. My mother is always sick with asthma and I take care of her a lot. 

Now that she’s not speaking to the family, it is truly us only. Well, us two and the dog. We have absolutely no one. She has a handful of friends but they’re always super busy working and have their own lives. 

My mom always makes plans for us two as if we are always going to live together. She never ever mentions me moving on my own one day, even though I have mentioned this in the past. 

Going back to her home country is not an option anymore so she’s staying here and I have to be there for her. She’s my mother and I absolutely love her. She’s the only person I’ve ever had. 

But the thought of living with my mother for the rest of my life makes me so sad. 

I’m 27 and I’ve never been in a relationship. I have focused in school and my career. The guys I’ve dated have never gotten serious with me. 

I’ve given up on finding someone because who is going to want to date someone who lives at home. And if I do date someone, it’s not like I’ll be able to make plans of living with them or marrying them because where will my mom go? 

She’s getting older and older so I have to take care of her more and more. 

This has depressed me so much that I’ve pretty much let go of myself. Don’t go to the gym, don’t go out, don’t socialize, nothing. 

My life is pretty much taking care of her, working, and video games. And even when I’m in my room doing my own thing, she makes me feel guilty about not hanging out with her. 

I know she’s lonely and that breaks my heart, but I feel like my life is passing me by because I have to be there for her. And feeling this way makes me feel like the worst daughter in the world.",lightingtrees,1641810108

848,CasualConversation,I was viciously attacked by a bull in Brazil on my 25th birthday (and only now sharing the story),"Hoping this will be therapeutic.

I was in Florianpolis, Brazil, celebrating my 25th Birthday. I had been warned earlier that night by a local that it was bad luck to celebrate another year older before the clock struck midnight. 

Oh, how I wish I had taken this advice. 

After an evening playing drinking games like “ride the bus” and “king of hearts” with my best friend and some strangers in the hostel, we were off to go clubbing. 

45 minutes in a taxi through winding roads and mountains (when we were told it was a 5 minute drive) was the first ominous sign of the night. 

The second, however, was far more ominous. By 2AM I had met a lovely german girl and we decided we’d danced enough and we’d head back to our hostels together (which were on the same street). 

As we exited the club and found an island in the middle of the road, we desperately tried to flag down a taxi. Car after car passed, but nobody stopped. 

As time wore on, our focus on getting a taxi was interrupted by some galloping in the distance. Confused as to why a horse would be roaming the streets, I turned around.

To my horror, there was a bull (and not a horse) not less than 15 metres away. The bull seem fixated on Eva, and I desperately tried to think of a plan for us to escape. But before I could, the bull turned to me and looked me right in the eyes. And deep into my soul. 

Little did I know at the time, maintaining eye contact with a bull is a sign of aggression. With no warning, the bull started charging towards me. In a panic, I sprinted to my left as fast I could.

That was the last thing I remembered.

Two minutes later, I woke up in a daze. Above me, a sobbing and hysterical German girl lay on her knees pleading me to wake up. She had blood (from my head) all over her forearms.

A crowd formed around me as I regained consciousness. I was told what had just occurred. Rather than being mortified, I broke out into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.

How unlucky could I possibly be?! I was in the middle of a major city and there just happened to be a bull running in the streets, who decided to choose me to attack, despite there being hundreds of thousands of others nearby. 

And all of this, on my birthday, while I was on the best vacation of my life.

I felt no pain. I had too much adrenaline (and alcohol) coursing through my veins. In the distance my best friend Ross came running. He had been told in the club that “some idiot had tried to charge a bull and got what he deserved”. 

The look on his face when he realized it was me was priceless. He went as ghost white as a half-Jamaican man possibly can. 

But after he saw that I was alive and in good spirits, the onslaught of jokes began. “I love you man, it’s been so nice getting to know you, say hello to god for me will ya” he proclaimed, after jokingly giving me a peck on the lips. 

I was then asked to pose for multiple pictures for the surrounding crowd. Laying on the ground, virtually motionless, I found the strength to raise each hand into a peace sign and crack a million-dollar smile.

As time wore on, I started to feel the pain. I started to grow cold. Had it been 10 minutes already? Maybe 15? Where was the ambulance? Was I going to be able to communicate with the paramedics when they came? Will they ever come?

Does my insurance cover these sorts of freak accidents? Will I need stitches, a head scan?

I had so many questions. And with every passing minute that went by, I was losing more blood, getting weaker, and became so cold I started to shiver.

Luckily, just as I started to get really concerned, an ambulance showed up, wrapped my head up, put my neck in a brace, and took me away on a stretcher.

Eva decided to come to the hospital with me, and I was very fortunate that she spoke Spanish, so that she could quasi-communicate to native Portuguese ambulance and hospital staff.

At the hospital, I remember waiting and waiting on a guerney. I wasn’t allowed to drink any water, and that combined with the hangover beginning to set in meant that I became a rather cranky fellow. 

Thinking I’d never be attended to, I remember becoming a little more panicky and shouty than I care to admit. But hey, it’s not every day you’re in a Brazilian hospital, with a big head wound after an angry bovine have you a piece of his horn.

To calm the “crazy man” that was I, a nurse rushed towards me with a giant syringe full of yellow liquid. With one swift jab in the arm, she infused my bloodstream with some sort of liquid serenity. Before I knew it, I was mumbling under my breath something like “Life is good”.

Eventually I was seen by the only English-speaking doctor at the hospital. He was astonished that a bull was the cause of my troubles. 

Apparently there had been a bull-running festival in Florianapolis, but it was closed down (for obvious reasons) over 20 years ago. And despite the fact that he had been a doctor in this town for decades, he had never seen a patient who was recently gored by a bull. 

Guess that makes me special?

An MRI, cat scan, seven stitches, a prescription and several hundred questions later, I was free to go.

I’ll still remember the feeling of tugging I felt as my head getting sewn up in a very rough manner.

By now it was noon and the sun was back up, hotter than ever. I was pushed out of the hospital on a wheel chair, with my head all wrapped up. I was mess. My eyes drooped, my skin was pale, and I had all sorts of scrapes, cuts and bruises on my face, neck, shoulders and back.

What next I thought to myself? Litres and litres of water and all the French fries in the world. What a wonderful suggestion from my newfound lady friend.

We hopped into a taxi and headed back down town. Getting out of the taxi, I hobbled. And my equilibrium was off. I had never felt so vulnerable, or so scared.

I distinctly remember seeing a dog running in my general direction (a tiny little one at that) and I was filled with horror. PTSD must have sunk it’s ugly claws into my psyche.

We sat down at a local diner, and I’ve never been so glad to dip a handful of French fries into a puddle of ketchup.",MDI88,1641808545
849,CasualConversation,My friend started being very rude with me,"So i know this happens often but i think my friend has some problems. i dont need any help, i just wanna share my thoughts with y'all.
Everything started in December 2020, when i met him. It was a pretty chill and casual person. We started playing a lot of video games and became very good friends till we decided to open a minecraft server. This dude was obssesd with Dream survival smp or whatever. so me, him and my best friend started a survival server. It was going smooth, we had fun until his friend came. His friend wanted the ip so we can turn this server into some battling Dream like smp, but he denied over and over until his friend got mad at him and he was left with no other choice than to give him te ip. shortly after his friend joined there were more friends of his friend. it was the same till one day he started being very rude with us and complaining that we dont play on his server every one bit of time we had. It got to the point we were like his cloth. I remember during this time he was going 2 days to his grandparents and we couldn't play on the server because the server was hosted on his pc. After his ""little vacation"" we played from 9 in the morning till 15 in the afternoon. I got bored and decied to hop off and write some code in my program. He started saying ""this is how happy are you the server is back on?"". At that time me and my friend were thinking to leave the server, i just leaved instantly the smp without thoughts of coming back and my friend strated swearing him. We left anyways and for a few weeks i just wrote code, doing what i liked. ocasionally some messages poped up from his saying i wont get anywere because i had the  Visual Studio discord status on. That messages demotivated me but yeah.. A few weeks later he made a new smp and insisted us to play on it. It was still the same. i just didnt talk to him and distance got beetwen us. a few months later(september 2021) he started messaging me that he got a girlfriend. he sayed me and my friends school to his real life friend friends. A month later he just messaged me saying that he broked up with that girl because something. He didnt have anymore friends and i decided to help him get over it. i introduced him to one of my girl friend(just friends, not being in a relationship) and he started being rude with me again. One time i told them what i ate and i gotta say i ate a little more. He started saying that i eat too much, my girl friend sayed ""again were starting?"", i just told her ""nah"", but that guy sayed ""nah should be"" and my girl friend told him that he eats more than me. He started swearing me because he started this (that was my fault in his eyes) and my girl friend sayed 2 him to calm down. In the present he's still very rude with me and i just ignore him.

860,CasualConversation,I wish we learned more about statistics in school. The world would be different today,"When I think back at my elementary and high school, I hardly remember some of the stuff we learned in math class. There was a lot of geometry, solving super specific equations (ie  n-th degree symmetric equations) and a lot of empty calculation. A lot is forgotten, even more is not used at all.

With all the COVID-19 stuff, I think it's become more clear than ever that most people lack even the most basic knowledge of statistics. I'm not saying that in a bad way, I'm just sad about it, it's the fault of the education system. Most people opposed to science regarding COVID don't understand that it's not all black and white, that percentages exist. Basic statistics like normal distribution, confidence intervals, deviations, it should be more stressed upon, spent more time on. I was surprised about how little is known by an average citizen of my country. *Don't even get me started on the knowledge of the scientific method and academic system lol*

I'd say statistics are one of the most accessible and most useful parts of mathematics. You see data all around you, there is so much happening, especially today. I think statistics should be brought into focus in elementary and especially high school math curriculum. Many of the problems we face during this pandemic would be resolved.

870,CasualConversation,Did the NFL force the ending of the Raiders vs. Chargers game to preserve the competitive sanctity of the league?,"Posting it here since it would probably get removed on the NFL sub. For context, there was a game tonight where two teams, the Chargers and Raiders, played each other and whoever won would make the playoffs. There was a caveat: if the teams tied, which meant that the scores remained the same after the overtime period, both would make the playoffs, instead knocking out the Steelers, where famous QB Ben Roethlisberger was retiring after this year.

The game actually was extremely close. The game was tied near the end of overtime, and the Raiders had the ball. With about a minute left, it was looking very likely the game would end in a tie. The Chargers coach then did something truly bewildering: he called a timeout, giving the Raiders more time to potentially win the game. With the extra time the Chargers gave them, the Raiders kicked a field goal and won the game, knocking out the Chargers.

All the explanations I’ve read for that last timeout make no sense. There were zero positive outcomes that timeout could have resulted in. You could probably hire 100 12 year old Madden players to coach the Chargers and not a single one of them would have called the timeout. I believe the only plausible explanation is that the NFL commissioner ordered the Chargers coach to call the bizarre timeout to avoid it looking like the two teams colluded to get into the playoffs.

At the risk of sounding dick sucky, I also think that I really like myself. I think that my own company is satisfying enough for me. Sharing my time with somebody I really love certainly sounds very appealing but I think I already do that with my close friends who I am very affectionate towards. This sort of outlook makes me feel like relationships are somewhat optional to me. I've also seen people my age lean on each other heavily for emotional support, it seems super unhealthy but extremely common for some reason. 

**BUT** the fact that I'm currently in college makes me feel very, very insecure about my aforementioned choices.

882,CasualConversation,I need advice for what to do with a girl,"tldr a girl was staring at me a little bit in two of my classes, we're both 16. I was already pretty sure I liked her, so I approached her in one of the classes, started talking, and eventually asked for her number. I gave her mine, then texted her that weekend. She didn't respond, but started staring more frequently. I unfortunately couldn't go talk to her anymore, and because of this I decided to try texting her again after a couple of weeks, gently asking if she didn't respond the first time because she didn't want me to talk to her. She didn't reply again, but then started staring at me pretty much any chance she could, and was fixing her hair at least once a class. I didn't think she wanted to talk to me, so I waited several weeks before doing anything, and she had been staring the whole time, even after we had a week off. I talked to one of her friends, and turns out she didn't text back because she has strict parents, and I think hasn't approached me because she's rather shy.

But, my schedule got changed so I don't have classes with her anymore. I really only see two options:

1. I see her in the hallways sometimes before my first class, but I haven't seen her without one of her friends and often we pass each other very briefly. I could try and catch her then, but its going to be rather awkward with her friend there, also awkward if I ask the friend to leave.
2. Or, I text her again telling her I noticed she used look over during class, and if that was because she wanted to talk to me, i'm usually in the library after school.

* or i could just text her saying I'd like to talk to her, i'm usually in the library before and after school, if there's a different way to word a text that you would suggest, lmk

I don't like trying to text again, clearly it's not a method of communication that works right now, but I know she will get the text and it is as quick as possible, and I want to act as soon as I can.

I don't want to wait any longer, but in initiating in person would probably be better. Its just this is not at all likely to happen and probably going to be a bit awkward as it's likely she's talking with her friends.

Her favourite movie is Pan's Labyrinth (it's even mentioned in her bio and the reason we started talking was because I asked her about her Halloween costume being a pale man cosplay) so I was thinking of taking her to a labyrinth outside a junkyard on the way to the art trail. and making some jokes about the movie, like oh I'm secretly a faun and you're the princess of the underworld lol.

So today I went to the labyrinth for the first time in a year to check on its present state. And it was fully buried under fallen autumn leaves! No recent maintenance which is a shame since it's a cool place. I decided to excavate the labyrinth, and spent about half an hour taking away leaves and unearthing it. Really cool actually.

How do we know that all ethnicities have the same capacity for intelligence?

The idea that all groups of people are functionally interchangeable or ""tabula rasa"" is the crux upon which postmodern Western civilization has been built. That's fine and morally proper. I have nothing against the idea, in and of itself. But I am genuinely concerned that it is a proposition that has *never been proven*. There is a reason that we still refer to American-style democracies as the ""great experiment"".

In addition to working under an unproven assumption, our adversaries (e.g. China) have no such moral scruples about race. Look at how they are treating the Uyghurs or how they are essentially re-colonizing Africa by financing infrastructure with unpayable loans. Furthermore, from a broad racial perspective, their country is relatively homogenous and has high a IQ potential. I know that they have lots of minor ethnic differences, but those differences are not as great as between, for example, Europeans and sub-Saharan Africans.

There is no denying that Western civilization is experiencing a malaise. The embarrassing withdrawal from Afghanistan was a painful demonstration of that. This happens to coincide with demographic shifts in many Western countries that are replacing high intelligence groups with low intelligence ones. In addition we are shoehorning groups into lines of work that they were traditionally thought to be ill-suited for. For example, when I got my engineering degree, there were all these diversity initiatives to get more females into engineering.

IF we are wrong in our assumptions, that would present a grave risk that our adversaries would (and perhaps do) exploit. Though understandably unthinkable to many, refusing to consider this possibility is simply irresponsible from a national security perspective. So I will ask again.

How do we know that all ethnicities have the same capacity for intelligence? If there is evidence to put my mind at ease, then please post it below.",the_fourth_way,1641787344

Im definitely not clinically depressed, I guess im just set in my routine? I just hope this year COVID gets better (long shot, not sure what better would even entail) and maybe I can take a vacation.

I know some of you might say (well, get a hobby etc) I do have hobbies. I mean generally, the daily monotony of life is just… I don’t know.

Bonus question: what is weed like? I’ve heard it described as being wrapped up in a warm blanket. How accurate is this?",radiantstuckiniron,1641777267

923,CasualConversation,does anyone else feel like they’re losing their personality?,"i feel like i’m slowly losing myself and what makes me “me.” i have always been shy and introverted but when i look back on the past, i feel like i used to be a lot funnier, talkative, outgoing and interesting. i’d talk to my friends for hours on end, reply to all my text messages and even try to make new friends. i used to read a lot and know so much about so many things. i was a straight A student. and everyone around me would value these traits too.

nowadays (actually for the past 2 years) i feel so… detached from everything. i don’t talk to anyone, hell i don’t even have anything to talk about. i feel dumb and stupid and incompetent. i have the attention span of a carpet now. i feel like i bore people and they don’t want to be around me. i am purposely staying away from dating because i think devoting myself to someone as i am right now would be so unfair to them. i feel like i lost something along the way. i don’t know. is it because of the pandemic? is it because of my depression? i thought i overcame it. i just don’t know and i wish i could stop feeling so miserable all the time. i am just 21. it should not be like this.

970,CasualConversation,I’ve been doing really well at staying out of my wife’s business regarding friendships,"A few months ago now my wife was having a fallout with some friends over a DnD session that went really badly. Won’t go into details but there was a lot of miscommunication and after the fact we found out the DM was lying about a lot of stuff intentionally or unintentionally. 

My wife is bad at confronting people, especially friends, so I wanted to be there as emotional support and backup if she couldn’t handle it. I know these people and some are my friends too. I was doing the good husband thing of taking my wife’s side and when she got overwhelmed and left in a flood of tears I stood up for her. 

Later I found out I should’ve stayed out of it. I didn’t have the full story and was mostly going in on the DM with “well my wife is crying and you’re a dick so fuck you”. Not the most convincing argument. I was an abrasive idiot and nearly made things way worse than they needed to be. 

I don’t regret sticking up for my wife but I do regret not leaving the Discord call with her and just letting her handle it at her own pace. Resolved to just stay the hell out of her relationships with her friends and especially not try to talk with them privately. I said some really cruel things to someone who did nothing wrong but who I felt didn’t defend my wife enough. I still feel horrible about that. 

So now, months later there’s a different drama unconnected to the last one, but I’m staying out of it! I’m here as my wife’s support and nothing more.

980,CasualConversation,Just yelled at a 50+ guy at IKEA for not washing his hands after peeing and it felt good.,"Started as a question if he forgot to wash. His reply was that he never touched anything with his hands. I had to explain to him that he touched his dick to which he replied that it was clean. I laughed a bit and told him he was a dumb motherfucker. He got all angry but ran off in the opposite direction. So, it was fun, fuck him for being a deuchebag, but the best part is that this one is going to stick with him. He got very angry so he will have to tell someone that he got yelled at like a 3yo toddler but at the same time he couldn’t really tell the story without sounding like a 3yo.

It goes down but very slowly

I tried the plunger method

I tried the vinegar and baking soda method

They work as i'm getting shit out

But the thing is, since the two sinks are connected, the water and shit goes to the other sink. Also all water just goes to the opposite also once the first sink fills

I also might think it's in the middle section, after the p pipes. I took of the p pipes and cleaned them and nothing

I swear, whoever made the bright decision of having double sided sinks, in a relatively small bathroom, is a idiot

I had very good teachers who has a passion for teaching and were able to communicate with their students their knowledge in such an effective way. I miss my friends too, sometimes we would bunk classes and sit in the canteen sipping chai, eating samosa's and gossiping the hours away.. college always felt like a safe space for me. I don't really feel the same way in my current University though. It's a big campus, arguably bigger than my college with big fields and various blocks and canteens and lots of people, but I still feel lonely here. Here I was thinking I would impress some girls on my first day of college, blow away the teachers with my brain, make lots of new friends but sadly none of it happened lol, such is life.

995,CasualConversation,I don’t know what to do and I really wanna go to bed right now,"So I just moved in to this apartment for month now. Things have been ok until yesterday. At around noonish I decided to take a nap for a few hours. 
Things were about to get interesting since then. I woke 5 hours later and tried to reach my phone on the floor. I realized there was water on my phone. 
At first I only thought that the water bottle was broken, but when I turned on the light I yelled to myself “WTF!!!! Why are there water all over the place LOL.” There were lots of water in the bedroom, in the bathroom and also in the living room. There was water on my Nintendo Switch and on my newly bought Macbook as well. Holy shhh I was panicking and called the building manager right away. 
An hour later, two men arrived. One tried to sucked the water out and the other tried to figure what happened there lol. 
After 5 hrs, nothing had changed. The water kept coming from nowhere and the guy still didn’t know what happened. Soon after they also had to shut down the water of the whole building too. At 1am, the manager called and told that they will move me to another unit and also suggested me go somewhere to sleep and they will pay for the taxi as well. 
Aghhh I’m tired right now. I haven’t had any sleep since yesterday and now I just came back to this mess waiting for someone to come to move me to another unit lol.
I have been under so much stress lately because of all the internship stuffs since it’s already my last year at school, and now I have this mess too.

1011,CasualConversation,As a College or Uni student is it worth buying an expensive phone for yourself?,"I'm really into iPhones and Samsung phones and I love their most expensive models like iPhone 13 pro max and Samsung s21 ultra are great phones. Every once in a while I start to think that when after college I will leave for Uni which phone will I get s21 ultra or maybe iPhone 13 pro max or maybe any newer model that just launched at that time like iPhone 14 or s22. parents often tell me to stop thinking about mobiles for now and once I graduate from college then I can have any phone I want no matter how costly it is. but sometimes I think and ask myself that what will I do with this expensive phone? Will I use it for heavy tasks? NO. Will I get any benefits from having an expensive phone rather than just having a decent phone with a good screen and decent battery life? NO. Do I even need a 1200 dollar phone? ABSOLUTELY NOT. 

I'm just jealous of my friends having such expensive phones and that's why I also want one. I keep on telling myself that it's just a waste of money but no matter how much I convince myself still the outcome is the same. I end up thinking that after graduating I will deserve a good phone since I never had a great phone before but a cheap phone which I bought when my parents told me to get one for myself because I should have one so I can contact them or anyone whenever I need to. They told me not to buy any phone that is above the price limit they gave to me and so I ended up buying a phone that was just ok. It had an ok screen. Battery life was great since I didn't use it for any heavier tasks. I couldn't game on it because of slow hardware or whatever it is and the camera was just fine. But didn't complain because I already had an iPad air at that time and I used to do my assignments on it and watch shows and everything else on my iPad and barely used my phone. 

But now after around 9 and a half months, things have changed. After my college new year started I saw many of my friends and classmates bringing expensive phones To college and everywhere we go together like to movies etc. I never had an interest in smartphones up until now.

I don't know why I even want an expensive phone. Is it because I'm jealous as I mentioned above. Whatever I will do on a phone that costs so much I can just aim for a phone in the 500 to 600 dollars range and it can do everything for me. I don't want to buy an expensive phone just so that I can take better photos and show them off. Besides no one needs an iPhone 13 or s21 or any other expensive phone at this age. 

No matter how positively I think I still end up thinking that it would just be a gift from my parents and that I should accept it. But then other days I think that mom and dad work hard every day for us and I shouldn't let them buy me an expensive phone. I should just buy an old flagship phone or any new decent phone and ask my parents to pay half payment for the phone and I think they will agree on that and will be happy as well but again after hardly one or two days my mood changes back to expensive phones. 

It's been happening like this for around 2 months now and I feel bad that I can't even make a simple decision so maybe you guys can help me sort out stuff...

for close to 10 years. His parents kicked him out of their house in high school and I let him stay with me until we graduated. He went into the military and we kept in touch. However when we go on leave he would just show up at my house with no heads up just expecting my parents to let him stay for a few. He was a friend so it was okay but I feel like it’s common sense to atleast ask or give a heads up. Fast forward a couple years and he decides to go awol from the military. He comes to my house once again unwarranted and I fear myself getting caught in some trouble so I kick him out. He constantly requested money from me and would always ask me to back him up on his lies. It got too much for me so I blocked him and I eventually moved. I know he needed help and I tried to help him multiple times but the help
he needed was above my limitations. I don’t know if this is the right sub for this but I just wanted to get this off my chest.

During my time using this site, I was introduced to a myriad of information.  The websites I discovered on this website ran the gamut as it pertained to their purpose.  Some of the sites were offensive, some were enlightening, others were funny, some were somewhat disheartening or even disturbing at times, other sites were inspiring, and others are down right terrible.  Despite, what I was presented I found myself drawn towards the discovery aspect of the site.  I enjoyed the way that some of information present challenged my views, made me ask questions and often times sent me down rabbit holes of discovery.

Lately I've been remembering a day when my dad, my cousin (five or so at the time), and I had gone across the street to eat.

We were sitting in one of those diners that had been around since you could smoke in them, old leather seats and all. There were a small handful of other people in there, but it was pretty slow. We ordered, and while we were waiting I got bored, so I started bothering my baby cousin.

I poked her on her cheek.

""Uncle Ryan she poked my cheeeeek.""

I poked her nose.

""Uncle Ryan she poked my noooose.""

Slowly closed in and poked her eyelid when she closed her eye.

""Uncle Ryan she poked my eeeeye.""

Finally, I poked her forehead.

""Uncle Ryan she poked my....
....
Uncle Ryan she poked me.""

Us and everyone in the diner laughed at her. She had no idea what a forehead was.

I could go for some stories. Anyone want to share?",Rotating_Coffin,1641734867

I became friends with this guy a few months ago and about a month ago he told me he liked me and wants to get to know me better so we we’ve been texting every single day for a few weeks straight. 
Now he just texted me he has to break off contact because he’s been neglecting his girlfriend and needs to focus on her now. 

I’ve never felt like such a fool in my entire life. I wasted so much time and energy for this guy only to find out I was his side hoe. His poor girlfriend I had absolutely no idea and feel so terrible.
I’ve never had a boyfriend because I never had an interest in anyone but he was the first one I didn’t reject after his “confession” and agreed to get to know him because he seemed like such a great guy while we were friends.

Anyways my best friends are busy with College stuff right now and I don’t want to bother them with my boy drama, so it’s been running through my mind all day and I’m sick of it.

1049,CasualConversation,Duff Beer - the family secret,"In the mid-1990s, a company here in Australia briefly produced a brand of beer called ""Duff"", using the same name as the fictional beer brand from The Simpsons. 20th Century Fox, the production studio of The Simpsons, pursued legal action against the company and the beer was ordered to be removed from store shelves and destroyed. As a result, cans of the beer became a very rare collectors' item, with a single case selling for $13,000 USD (according to Wikipedia). 

Several years ago when I was at my grandma's house as a young teenager, I was asked to clean my uncle's old room and sort through his old clothes. Although my uncle had since moved out of the house long ago, everything in the room was still left the way it was when he lived there, and he kept using the room as a storage place for his stuff. 

While cleaning the bedroom wardrobe, I discovered that a portion of the back wall could be removed, with the loose panel hidden behind stacks of folded clothes and boxes of junk. I removed the panel and crawled through, to find a tiny room ***filled*** with Duff beer, like 80 full cases - possibly worth over a million dollars.

So I got a job sorted earlier this week. I basically have to go through an academic paper, which means sitting down for a few hours in front of the computer. It pays good and it relies on some intellectual talents I got which are a rare commodity.

I'm struggling with really bad mental issues and my life isn't that stable. My idea was spending a couple of days just relaxing and getting my stresses vented out so today I'd be able to find the calm I need to sit down and work.  
It felt fine for a while and I actually felt like I'm worth something. My intention was to work after back from a walk with my partner we tend to do these days daily, but now suddenly the intrusive thoughts are creeping back in and I can feel that anxiety threatening to shake me up again.

I'm supposed to be medicated for this, but for circumstances I rather not disclose beyond saying 'we can't afford', we don't have access to that right now.  
I think I just want some company to talk about shit and stuff, but I can't say I trust what I feel I want too much. All I know for sure is I want some peace of mind so I could start an effective work today.",dmon654,1641720191

Yooo, that shit felt so real. It didn't feel like heaven or hell, it was just blackness. And I felt the moment I disappeared too, and it felt SO REAL. I felt myself scream the moment it happened, in the dream, and no one could hear me because I stopped existing. Then a bunch of lines appeared in the darkness but they were faint lines.

My intentions were never to hurt anyone, I just wanted to be heard. I met John on vacation, hung out over the course of several days together. I started to catch feelings for him, and I could sort of tell that he liked me too. He got jealous because another guy, Jim, was hitting on me when I was drunk, and Jim wanted to hook up, and John drunkenly told a bunch of people that he liked me.

I pulled him to the side when I found out and asked him if that were true. Turns out, he had a girlfriend the entire time. I was disappointed, but since we live in different countries, I figured we could be internet friends at least. However, he rejected my Instagram request. I blocked John for a couple of days. Because he wanted to do the right thing for his girlfriend. I understand, but I don't like being treated as if I don't exist.

The day after, Jim messaged me asking me if I was okay. I wasn't. I told him that I hated John. John should come clean about his feelings, and tell his girlfriend that he's an asshole to her, and let her go. It wasn't fair that he led her on like how he led me on. I told Jim that I wanted to hurt myself, and that I was seriously thinking about ending my life. I said that I wanted to have a family so bad, but I don't know if that'll ever happen.

Jim was definitely shaken by what I said, but he still tried to be caring and empathetic to my situation. However, he told another friend, and that friend told John. John knows what I said, and he hasn't done anything to me, but all I know is that he broke up with his girlfriend. I don't know if he told her, but they're not together. Now, he's always looking at my social media. Whether its TikTok, Twitter, he always views my things. Why does he? Shouldn't he be repulsed by my threat? Or angry with me? Both? Even if he did really like me, surely he'd be turned off enough to never look at my social media again. And my intention was not for them to break up, it was just that he be honest with her. If I had a boyfriend, I'd want to know if he said he liked another girl.

Tl;dr: guy got jealous that some other dude was hitting on me. He told everyone that he liked me, when he actually had a girlfriend the entire time. He cut off all contact with me.

So, I logged in to check if anything sus was being used on it. Thankful there weren't. Then I realize it's not my main Facebook account because it has only 20 friends hahaha and most of those friends are childhood friends in real life. AND OH BOY!!! It made me gooo down into a whole spiral of emotions! I got happy, shocked, sad to depressed! Like wow! First, I was shocked and happy that my good friend from middle school is happily married and has children. Then I saw a post of this classmate who totally changed  which was a shocker and happy for them. Lastly, I was sad to see a very good friend who I can't really call best friend anymore that doing they're finally doing well and happy. 

It may sound I'm jealous of them, I'm not. It just got me thinking. That this is why I left Facebook in the first place. It makes me sad/depress how I wasn't able to walk the same path as they are. Like we've been all been together from elementary, middle school all the way to first year of college then all of a sudden proof! We found our own niche of happiness and forgotten each other. I'm a very sentimental person so this is really a trip for me. Even though some of my other friends still lives nearby we don't talk anymore that much. We would just wave hi to each other and that is it. 

Like, it took me years to finally understand the saying ""Don't be a stranger"" . Before I deactived my main Facebook account. I saw my friend and we were catching up and when she left she said that. I was so confused because I know I was going to see her again. Then a couple months later I saw her post that she moved and we never connected after that. It could have been avoided to be a stranger from friends if I only reached out to them but I didn't want to that annoying person asking every other post. 

To this day.. I get blocked or my ""friends"" turn off their comment section on Instagram because I would comment on it by congratulating or saying some inside joke.

1099,CasualConversation,"I changed my major, so now I’m finally happy","Long post: tldr at the bottom 

Hey guys! For the past couple days I’ve been very happy with myself for finally changing my college major. I’m a junior and for the first 2 and a half years, I was a biology major. I didn’t know what I wanted to do in college, but I picked biology because it has higher job prospects and pay and I enjoyed that class in high school, so why not. Well, fast forward to now and I realized it wasn’t for me. I started struggling really hard and had several mental breakdowns from all the stress. I wanted to drop out of college, but I’m not a quitter so I made myself push through. Hell, I even picked my university strictly because of how good it’s biology department is, so why change majors either?

I kept thinking about what if I had chosen to be an English major. I could become a writer or maybe an editor. I’d always loved writing. I read a lot, too. English has always been my strongest subject. But I was a victim to sunk cost fallacy, so I stubbornly stayed as a biology major.

Finally, I had enough. My advisor told me to sign up for 2 chemistry classes for this  semester which ended up being a breaking point. I couldn’t do it anymore. Chemistry was my worst subject and stressed me out the most, so why would I allow myself to go through that torment again? I told my parents that I was going to change my major and they supported me. They were happy that I finally picked something that I liked because all I did was complain for the past year for how much I hated what I was doing. I told my friends and they were happy for me, too. They said it was much more fitting. 

So here I am, I’m finally an English major. I might apply for a biology minor just so I don’t feel like I wasted all that time for nothing. I’m pretty happy about my choice and I know it won’t be easy, but I really hope this is the right choice. And, excitingly enough, I was told that I might be able to graduate early! 

Have any of you guys gone through anything like this? I’m the only one of my friends to have done it, ha. Also, any advice from fellow English majors out there?

TLDR: I majored in biology for 2 and a half years and grew to hate it. I finally mustered up the courage to change my major to something I actually enjoy and am good at aka English.",Astra_docx,1641705402

1127,CasualConversation,I always wanted to learn to play Call Of Duty but my ex made fun of me. My husband helped me learn and I am now very good at it,"That’s it. I am not bragging, I am proud and so is he. My ex always let me play only for a few minutes, thinking I was just “ cute “ for wanting to try. The thing is, I wanted to learn for real and play with them on their consoles but none of them really taught me how or took the time to teach me and play with me for more than five minutes and I was too insecure to buy a console for myself. 

I bought a PS5 for my husband one year ago and after a few weeks, I finally told him I wanted to learn how to play COD. He said he’d be happy to teach me and play with me. We played 45 minutes almost every night after the kids went to bed, for a whole year. I told him to play with me exactly how he normally plays, so he is not letting me win on purpose at all. I, of course, was very bad at it at first but kept trying and asking questions. I really wanted to learn this specific video game because I thought it was nice. 

He’s been very patient, caring, non-shaming and I learned how to play quite fast because I was interested. I am now better than him at COD and instead of feeling insecure or something like that, he always says how proud he is and he gives me fist bumps and says things like « You are AMAZING! Wow! This was impressive! » 

It makes me very happy. 
I grew up in a very strict and gendered household and I was not free to learn to do what my father thought were « boys things » at all. I had to be cute and quiet but I wanted to play video games, soccer and learn how to build things.

1130,CasualConversation,Guy that cut me off watches my social media now that he knows about my suicidal thoughts,"I met John on vacation, hung out over the course of several days together. I started to catch feelings for him, and I could sort of tell that he liked me too. He got jealous because another guy, Jim, was hitting on me when I was drunk, and Jim wanted to hook up, and John drunkenly told a bunch of people that he liked me.

I pulled him to the side when I found out and asked him if that were true. Turns out, he had a girlfriend the entire time. I was disappointed, but since we live in different countries, I figured we could be internet friends at least. However, he rejected my Instagram request. I blocked John for a couple of days. Because he wanted to do the right thing for his girlfriend. I understand, but I don't like being treated as if I don't exist.

The day after, Jim messaged me asking me if I was okay. I wasn't. I told him that I hated John. John should come clean about his feelings, and tell his girlfriend that he's an asshole to her, and let her go. I was crying, and I said a lot of things I shouldn't have. I told Jim that I about my bulimia problem, and my suicidal thoughts. That I was really struggling, and that I think about ending it almost every day.

Jim was definitely shaken by what I said, but he still tried to be caring and empathetic to my situation. However, he told another friend, and that friend told John. John knows what I said, and he hasn't done anything to me, but all I know is that he broke up with his girlfriend. I don't know if he told her about me, but they're not together anymore. Now, he's always looking at my social media. Whether its TikTok, Twitter, he always views my things.

Tl;dr: guy got jealous that some other dude was hitting on me. He told everyone that he liked me, when he actually had a girlfriend the entire time. He cut off all contact with me. I got upset by what he did, and I told a mutual friend that I was struggling, especially because I have bulimia and thoughts of suicide.

1134,CasualConversation,"M24 Beyond meeting a woman and initial impressions, I’m no longer interested in actually following up. Why?","Ok I’ll give some context. 

Since I’ve gotten out of my last relationship, it’s been difficult to connect with women to date/hook up/ or even be a new friend. 

I’ve never really had an issue getting a number or talking in general off of first impressions or even past that, but after I make my first initial push, I just lose interest. 

For example if I see a girl I think is really pretty or something, I’ll DM her or approach her. I’ll get her number, text her a few times then lose all will to actually see her again in person. Why is this you think? I feel like this is just a phase but I’m trying to figure out if I’m more in love with the idea of seeing someone, rather than actually doing it (go out with them on a date or even hang out). 

And no I don’t ghost them it’s sort of like we’ll have a good conversation then it’ll end and I just won’t start it back up. 

I’ve been with a few women since my break up last year but it was on terms of women I’ve know for over a decade. So this post is more of the tune of new women I meet. 

To offset this feeling, I’ve been giving more energy to the current relationships in my life, mainly female (since I don’t have gf I really just give that attention and money I’d use on them, not in a creepy way though, I know the boundaries) friends but male friends too.

1135,CasualConversation,This isn't a great era to be young,"Maybe I'm being dramatic, but growing up in the last couple decades has been kind of a shit show, and the pandemic has been the cherry on top of everything. I feel like I'm starting my adulthood looking to a future of unaffordable housing and a climate crisis, all with a lack of faith in our ability to do anything about it.

When my parents were my age they were nearly able to do anything they wanted with their time, money, and degrees, but I can barely afford to buy a couch.

EDIT: I’m not trying to minimize the struggles of generations past. Our history has always been full of struggle and turmoil for different populations.

There are a lot of mentions to past wars and events in the 20th Century that also made life difficult for youth, and while I agree those events were earth-shatteringly difficult, I think the most pressing issue of our time (and thing that keeps many of us up at night) is the climate crisis, which is something that can't be stopped by ""putting down our guns,"" but needs to be stopped through global societal change.

We should have started winding down our overproduction and overconsumption of resources decades ago, but we haven't, and our global population has risen to meet our overconsumption, which means that we can't stop without causing a global societal collapse. As a species, we need to be focusing on that issue alone as soon as possible, but we're haven't been. As a young person, and unlike being a young person during the wars of generations past, it feels like our elders are actively screwing over future generations, not just the current one. Once we push our ecosystems to the complete brink of collapse, it'll be over. I'm much more worried about the generations that have yet to be born than my generation.",Motherlover222,1641691270

Being on my last year of school is a weird feeling that I'm not used to. 

So, I want to ask, how did you all deal with that feeling? How did you cope? What did you do afterwards? And, if you're going through it now, how are you coping at the moment?

Now, I know. I've always been very introverted, and the summer before high school, a girl started harassing me online. She tormented me so bad, and it lead to me having suicidal thoughts. I'd think about ending my life every day. 

However, I met a lot of amazing friends, and that helped me a lot. Freshman year was really hard for me, but I got through it. Sophomore year, I went through a bit of a rough patch at first because there was a guy I liked that didn't like me back. However, by junior year, I was completely focused on myself and my friends. I got honor roll every semester, getting above a 3.5 every time. I wasn't popular, but I had plenty of friends that were really cool, and that was all I needed. 

Spring semester of senior year, my best friend got upset that I went to a dance with some girls she didn't like. She didn't go herself, but she still was jealous that I was with them. As a result, she started talking about me behind my back. I started to sit by myself at lunch, and soon, no one would talk to me. To that point, I didn't think about suicide, but the thoughts came back then. My grades plummeted, and I only got a 3.2. I hated myself, and there was a day where I came close to ending it all. My high school graduation wasn't this climatic event that I thought it was, and I thought it would be bittersweet, but all I got was a diploma from there. I didn't get any friends or anything.

My parents literally yelled at me for no reason.

They asked if I wanted to go along with them to the mall. I said no because it’s cold and snowy where we live and I already had a cold last week. 

I was in my room when I heard my mom say “she’s just sitting around, didn’t even get ready”. My dad said something too but everything happened so quickly that I don’t remember. I went over and said “why do you get mad over little things.” He then told me to go back to my bed and sit there all day.

First of all there’s so many restrictions here that we can’t even go places I’d want to. Second the weather is so bad. 

I then left saying I don’t wanna go and that it’s cold. 

As I sat back in my room I heard my mom say she was looking for a receipt and my dad was walking towards my room to ask me where it was. That’s when I heard my mom say “she’s gonna start yelling again.” 

When my dad opened the door he was in the middle of asking me for the receipt and I asked him why she said that. He slammed the door and opened it again just to yell at me. 

They both yelled at me and told me to shut up and stormed off. All I was asking is why she said that and I was trying to tell him that he never got a printed copy of the receipt  cause he got it emailed.

But no one even listened. He just yelled and they both left.

1169,CasualConversation,My mom called my professor and I've never been more embarrassed.,"Hi there, I hope this is the right place to post, I just need to vent a little :P
Any comforting words are much appreciated.

Basically, I'm 20 years old and just started college last fall. Not gonna lie, I had a rough start. It was mainly a lot of self doubt and wondering whether I chose the right path, not really knowing where to go with my life. Deciding on a career is a big step after all, right? I don't wanna give to much information, but I was definitely second guessing my choices.

Well, it's been a few months and I'm feeling much better. I love what I do, and I'm sure it was the right decision. So, that's good I guess.

However, my mom recently mentioned how she called my professor to let her know I wasn't feeling well back then. My initial reaction was ""You did WHAT??""
She then went on to tell me how she thought it would be a good idea to get her involved. She told her everything. That I wasn't sure I made the right decision, that I was basically a mess... She gave a lot of detail, to say the least. 

I am MORTIFIED. Yes, it's been a few months, and my professor never mentioned anything, but still! What kind of impression is that?? ""That 20 year old had her mom call me""

My mom tried to comfort me by telling me that my professor reacted very nicely and assured her everything would be fine. But just the thought of my mom calling her like I need some sort of special treatment... 

I'm so embarrassed. I don't know how she can take me seriously after this.

Now I honestly don't know if I'm overreacting, but I'm really angry. That was some personal stuff I discussed with my mom, I didn't want anyone else to know about this. Especially not my professor who's going to grade me.

Now if you excuse me, I'll be digging myself a hole to hide in. ByeBye, self esteem.",StupidQuestionAlert_,1641679185
1170,CasualConversation,Manifested for my crush to approach me. Her mother did instead.,"In my early twenties and I seem to be extremely particular about the women I date. My family make fun of me for it but I can't help liking what I like. 

Because of this, it's been a few years since my last relationship. Like with my last girlfriend though, it was love at first sight, and when I like someone I usually ask them out. 

This time however, the girl that caught my attention was a relative stranger that I had no way of getting to know. We both work in the same mall (she works at the Wendy's kiosk) and I work in one of the stores. 

I'm a relatively healthy guy, though. So there is no genuine reason for me to start going to Wendy's on a regular basis in the hopes of building a rapport with this girl. 😬 

So I mentioned this to my sister and how I think this girl is cute (she knows how rarely this happens). And the best suggestion she could give me is that I manifest the energy or what I want. If it is meant to be then it will happen. 

So I started going to bed the last few nights giving this manifestion thingy a go. I'd think intensely on the girl and for an opportunity to become better acquainted with her naturally. I did this for a week every night for a week and then I'd sleep. 

Some backstory: my sister used to work at a clothing boutique in the same mall and knows of the Wendy's. She told is it was family owned and operated. Apparently the older woman who works there is the mother, the older man is the father, the young guy is the son, and the girl is their daughter. 

Anyway, for the last week, the mother of the Wendy's (mother of my crush) has started coming into my store suddenly and getting served by me. Never talks to any of my co-workers, but when served by me, keeps trying to start full-on conversations with me. 

Today, the mother confessed I'm conversation that she's 'noticed me around a lot'. And we began talking about my work schedule. 

""I always see you in the mornings getting your daily coffee. You must work a lot!!!"" 

And I just find this hilarious because I've worked here for a few years now and this woman has never come into the store and never bothered to talk to me. And as soon as I start manifesting she's begun taking a concerted effort to get to know me. 

Not sure if my manifestation is working. Or if it is just attracting heavier he wrong person. 🤣",TheSummerViking,1641679066

1178,CasualConversation,Do you ever get upset that you’ll never be able to experience the past?,"I’m 19F, was born in early 2002. My early childhood consisted of VHS tapes, no other electronics besides the TV and occasionally watching something like a muppet video on the computer with my dad, playing outside and with actual toys, reading books, and exploring the woods with my brother. I remember always feeling happy and busy back then, and just in general feeling satisfied with life.

I can 100% say technology has changed that for the worse. And it’s not even one of those situations where I can just avoid using it in order to replicate the old feeling, because it’s required for quite literally everything. People rely on it now because the world is built around it.

I know it’s a cliché for people to say they were “born in the wrong generation”, but I truly wish I had been born in the late 60’s/early 70’s. Being able to grow up entirely internet free would have been amazing. My mom was born around that time, and hearing her talk about it makes it sound like the dream. She doesn’t sugarcoat the bad parts, but in general I think I would have had a happier life.

I’m a social person, so being able to bike to my friend’s houses and hang out all together outside until the streetlights came on would have been amazing. Playing physical games, actually hearing people’s voices over the phone instead of text, getting new music by buying records or tapes, eventually CDs, and just not feeling like you’re online 24/7 would be incredible. 

Plus the added bonus of college without online stuff, being able to afford a place to live, getting a good job without needing a masters and years and years of experience, being able to buy a house and choose whether or not you wanted to stay home with your kids if you have them rather than needing 2 incomes and daycare.

The first time I had this reading, I asked what this could mean. They danced around the topic but I ascertained that it meant I was going to die. The next two times it happened I bluntly asked if it meant I was going to die, and the reaction was both dismissive but also there was no denial. 

Normally, with things like this I usually take them with a grain of salt, but the fact that it was the \*same\* result each time leads me to believe that either a) the art of fortune telling is MUCH more consistent in technique then I would have ever thought, or b) I'm in trouble this year lol (I'm 29). 

Basically, what experiences have other people had with their fortunes being told? I'd be lying if I said these readings haven't affected me, just purely based on how consistent and oddly specific they were. I'd love to hear some more perspectives on this!",sirleithalot,1641668388

I'm not good at anything and yeah it sucks but there's nothing I can do about it so I just don't think about it.  I always really liked accounting and economics and really blasted my own ASS to get 90+ grades in those at least,  I enjoyed them but it's been two years since I've actually sat down to study them. I'm anxious I have been for a long time and have been trying to avoid studying thinking I can just do it the next day. Well I started getting more anxious about actually failing lately and even though my friends say they're gonna fail, they're not.  I just know they're not, they are way smarter than me, even if they dont study they'll get A so I started studying today.  I did like the first 8 chapters of economics in two hours and I felt so very proud ngl. I was like wow I got this I can finish all of it if I really wanted to. Well,  that all went down hill.  I called with a friend to study with her and was talking about it when she said they're the most easiest chapters and I guess they're not really a big deal for her. It kinda brought me down i did work hard though.  I havent in a long time, i kinda just wanted to hear wow that's nice you did great.  Suddenly im feeling so very out of it now.  I dont feel like studying anymore there's no point really I'm not gonna do as well as them or well at all.

I was going to order food and everyone working there was showing everything they had, super proud. 
I ordered a rice dish with chicken, and they gave me a lot of sides of everything they thought i had to try.

1216,CasualConversation,A bug got inside my ear," I have a fear of bugs. I think they are disgusting and horrifying.  One of my worst nightmares is a bug getting inside my ear. I watched a kid get a tick inside his ear on TV before and it was a huge one, very horrifying.

 Two days ago, I was just lying down in my bed scrolling through reddit in my phone, when suddenly I heard a buzzing sound near my ear. In a panic, I tried to scratch my ear with my hand and then I felt the bug crawl inside. I screamed really loud, and screamed for my parents. I told them ""THERES AN INSECT INSIDE MY EAR!!!! AAAAAAAAAAHH!!!"". They told me to hold a flashlight against my ear so that the bug will come out since they are drawn to lights.

 I did what they said and opened my phone's flashlight and put it against my ear, I remembered something I saw online a long time ago that you can remove bugs and dirt in your ear using a syringe (without needles) with warm water to wash your ear. Unfortunately we didn't have a syringe so that won't work, so all I could think about is how the bug inside my ear will lay eggs inside and might try to bite me.

 Fortunately, the bug began to crawl and I could feel each of its steps and it so uncomfortable and itchy it made me want to use Q-tips in my ear but I won't do that since I heard it will only push the bug down further. Every time the bug moved, I screamed, I really really really hate bugs. Well, in the end the bug got out and I was traumatized and will always wear headphones from now on.

1220,CasualConversation,Could you drink every day? Every other day?,"So I'll usually have a glass or two of wine a day, sometimes a beer or two, sometimes a few actual drinks. Some days I won't drink as much or at all. I'm 25 and male. My stomach has already been feeling weird lately so I won't drink too much but I had 3 malt beers the other day (a 22 ounce, regular 12 ounce and a 22 or something), yesterday I had some wine, truly and drank a lil whiskey. I'm thinking about going to grab a few 22s/40s (Modelos, Colt 45s, etc) to have some with my weed for this Saturday but I don't know if drinking like this is negative. I normally don't get fucked up drunk or anything but could get hella tipsy. 

I read that it's safe to have one or two drinks per day but no more than 3 a week. Which logically doesn't make sense. Why would they word it like that? Saying 1 or 2 drinks per day literally insinuates that you could and would drink 1 or 2 drinks multiple days in a row throughout the week, but saying it caps out at 3 would then be redundant. Thats like saying ""you can drink for a day and a half"". 

I know people that drink wine and trulys every day, another person that drinks beer every day, some people out here drinking bottles every other day, then there's people that have a beer or three after work every day, or a few glasses of wine, and never have an issue, doing so for years. But then some people that drink like that for just a few years could encounter GI problems, etc. 

Then there's other places saying no more than 4 drinks a day, 14 drinks a week (for men).

1232,CasualConversation,Soo I got treated as a fatphobic for wanting to lose weight.,"So, this happened earlier today and I'm half baffled and half wondering if I fucked it up.

Besides, I have high cholesterol by genetics so better to stay lean)

Thing is, a friend asked me to delete the story as I was bodyshaming other people. I asked her why and she replied that as I look skinny and look forward to be skinnier I was passing judgment on everyone who did not look as skinny as me, while perpetuating damaging beauty models. I replied that I just look forward to feel better with myself and stay healthy, that turning that into some fatphobic thing was a bridge too far and she replied that in that case I should have keep. It to myself but by publishing it I was showing how I valued more to be skinny  than to be fat. I replied that if she was going to feel attacked because I look forward to improve myself while she fails at her own body acceptance it was her problem. And she did not reply anything else

1268,CasualConversation,Sometimes I do dumb decisions.,"I am going to preface this that I was taking an exam in English language which I need for master's study abroad.

So the story goes:

I was taking a part of an exam (speaking) today and I was lucky enough *in sarcastic tone* to be asked to talk about clothing and answer some questions. Obviously I know nothing about that.

So I was making shit up, mostly and probably it worked. Well, I think.

And I had this big question (2 minutes of speaking) about a piece of clothing I got from someone else as a present, and because I barely remember when, if ever, I got something from someone else. I had 2 minutes to prepare my answer.

Since there wasn't really nothing to work from I just told him straight away we can just start immediately and that I am going to make something up.

And my last two working brain cells fighting for the third place decided to roll with *Wermacht Trench Coat from my Grandma"".

At that time it seemed like a great idea.

1284,CasualConversation,What’s going on???,"I’ll sum it all up real quick: I used to have a really close friend for like 5 years. During our last years as friends, I noticed how toxic our relationship was, and decided to end things with her. 
 
What she’d usually do: 

-She’d ignore me, look for me when she couldn’t find her other friends, talk sht behind my back, said I was a bad influence, she would kiss everyone except me cause she said she felt weird doing it (?? among other stuff…

Contrast: 
-She’d call me late at night telling me I was her only real friend, she’d go crazy anytime I mentioned I wanted to stop seeing each other, told me she loved me the most in the entire world, she’d go around telling others  she had depression cause I didn’t want to hang out w her anymore even tho any time I’d go looking for her she’d ignore me and never went looking for me unless there wasn’t anyone else available.


All in all, she was crazy. I tried to help her, but it wasn’t doing us any good. I feel for her cause on the outside her life seems kinda perfect (she’s popular, smart, and rich-rich). But knowing her for many years made me realize all of that was messing w her head. 

I hope she’s able to get over all of that and find people she feels fine with. But that’s not the point here.

During our time together, she’d kinda guilt trip me for having friends outside her friend group. So I was left all alone once our friendship was over.

It’s been three years since then, and I’ve now got a friend group of about 8-10 people. Among them there’s a girl who I get along well with. I used to hang out with here during the time in which my so called friend ignored me, so we kinda have known each other for a while. 

The thing about this girl is that she seems GENUINELY interested in our friendship. We have lots of things in common and kinda contrasting personalities, so hanging out with her is tons of fun. 


Still, I’m afraid things will go wrong again and haven’t been able to fully let go yet. 

We do lots of silly meaningless stuff like giving each other nicknames or having inside jokes, and tbh it all makes me kinda happy. 

Still, as I mentioned my past w other girl left an impact on me tho it doesn’t affect my life as much as it used to. 

She really wasn’t a good friend. Her behavior always Mande me uneasy since I was always trying to figure out what she meant with what she said. 

Last month my class went on a field trip, and she happened to be there. I didn’t try to avoid her, and I didn’t look for her either. Still, she approached me when I went away to get a bottle of water from my bag, and gave me a pay on the head(?

I just gave her an awkward smile since I didn’t know what to do atm. I honestly hope I never see her again once we graduate.

1303,CasualConversation,Has anyone just been really frustrated trying to find things they can eat?,"So I've reached a part of my life where trying to find anything I can eat is just a new kind of pain in the behind. A few years ago, I began noticing I was having a lot of problems with eating, specifically the results of eating. If I eat the wrong thing, I get sick, certain foods result in me being in pain and cramping, constantly having to go to the bathroom etc. A few months ago I decided I had enough after getting violently ill after eating pork with rice, asparagus and caramelized onions. Honestly one of my favorite dishes not going to lie. I made sure everything was cooked right, I used a dairy alternative where I needed to (I had started going dairy free due to thinking it was lactose intolerance) and it was fine. But half an hour later as I was walking with my friends I was just in horrible pain, crying and ended up having to sit on a bench while my friend got her car. I went to the doctor a few days after where his best guess was IBS and from there I was trying to find what caused the most issues and what alternatives worked best. The main two I noticed the most problems with being pork and dairy and I've been encountering more foods as I go. I had been fine for a while but as I've started catching more foods, I've noticed my recipe pool was draining more and more. I've had to knock off recipes due to what was in it, what reactions it caused, organizing what was my safe foods and what wasn't, etc. Going to new restaurants gets me as nervous as the exams I was taking. 

What broke me was a couple of days ago. I had gone to visit my grandparents and it turns out my grandparents decided to go to an Italian restaurant, one of the only food categories that practically only uses dairy or some form of pork. I broke down in the restaurant because literally everything I could see contained some form of dairy or pork. It was quite possibly one of the worst experiences I've felt in a while and because I was told rather sharply by my mother to ""not start shit"" I never felt more frustrated. It was like no one was listening, even though they said they checked it out and said there were options, all I could see was dairy in everything. All I could see was people adding cheese or ground pork to meatballs, pasta cooked in butter and cheese, every dish being layered in cheese. And by that point, the majority of my visit the places we got food from quite literally ignored my no dairy restraint. I order a dish with a salad and they add cheese on it. I ask for no dairy and I could taste it on the shrimp. Thankfully the waitress saw how stressed I was and stressed to the best she could to not put dairy anywhere near my food but the feeling of being ignored by my family was mind boggling, especially after they knew I couldn't eat that. 

It's been extremely frustrating to be taken seriously and trying to find foods I can enjoy thats not expensive is like being on a wild goosechase. I have no idea what I can do anymore.

Not kidding the last time I went out with him was almost 2 years ago on our last family vacation before COVID (5-10 min grocery shopping not included). 

Also were I grew up a lot of my older relatives have networked a lot and made friends that can later on act as a hand to their kids or any one in need, I don’t think I can say that for my father not even my older brother and I don’t have to I’m just saying as a kid I used to ask myself why does my father/brother lack a lot of these traits that others have. But they’re still the kind loving father/brother I love.

I love the idea of a father acting as friend to his kids and to a certain limit even when they get older. This also opens my mind that I should provide my kids later on with what I’m missing right now in my life.

1312,CasualConversation,Anyone else just feel guilty with how easy life has been?,"Just wondering if you guys also feel like some form of guilt for how easy life has been for you?

I grew up in a middle upper class family in the USA. I’m 1 of 6 being the 3rd child. Both my parents were refugees from the Vietnamese war. 

My mom was a stay at home parent and my dad was a lead electrical engineer for a company, and often got projects from a bunch of other companies.

Throughout my entire childhood pretty much nothing bad happened. Then I went to college and recently just graduated with my BS in CS as a B average student .

Through my dad I was able to get multiple internships throughout college and already have my 1st job after graduating with a 100k+ year salary not including any extra bonuses.

I have a wonderful GF who I’ve been with ever since my 1st semester of college who also has a similar backstory to mine and is almost finished with her nursing program. Both our parents are also chipping in to help us buy our 1st house with how expensive they’ve been getting recently.

I just think about what I’m struggling with right now and can’t help but compare how it’s like nothing compared to what my parents or peers have been dealing with.

My dad was 1 of 13 and my mom was 1 of 10 so neither of them had any help growing up since my grandparents were all refugees working minimum wage jobs. 

My dad was 21 when my parents had my eldest sibling ,was working a full time minimum wage job, was a full time student, and had stomach ulcers so he had to get his stomach pumped 2x a week all while helping my mom who also worked a full time.

So I just sort of feel guilty with how easy life has been for me. Feels like I didn’t really do anything to deserve everything I have but rather had everything in life handed to me.",Historical-Judge899,1641614011

1315,CasualConversation,I need advice for what to do with a girl,"tldr a girl was staring at me a little bit in two of my classes, we're both 16. I was already pretty sure I liked her, so I approached her in one of the classes, started talking, and eventually asked for her number. I gave her mine, then texted her that weekend. She didn't respond, but started staring more frequently. I unfortunately couldn't go talk to her anymore, and because of this I decided to try texting her again after a couple of weeks, gently asking if she didn't respond the first time because she didn't want me to talk to her. She didn't reply again, but then started staring at me pretty much any chance she could, and was fixing her hair at least once a class. I didn't think she wanted to talk to me, so I waited several weeks before doing anything, and she had been staring the whole time, even after we had a week off. I talked to one of her friends, and turns out she didn't text back because she has strict parents, and I think hasn't approached me because she's rather shy.

But, my schedule got changed so I don't have classes with her anymore. I really only see two options:

1: Do I text her telling her I noticed her looking over last semester, and ask if she was looking over because she wanted to talk to me, if so I'm usually in the library for a few minutes after school.

2: Or, I wait to try and talk to her in the hallways, but dont really think that's likely to happen

I don't like trying to text again, clearly it's not a method of communication that works right now, but I know she will get the text and it is as quick as possible, and I want to act as soon as I can.

I don't want to wait any longer, but in person would be preferable. I don't see her in the halls every day, and she's often with friends and even if I do see her it's often brief and the halls are crowded. So, its not guaranteed at all I will get to talk to her if I see her in the halls.

So idk which is the better option.",Dont_try_it7,1641613646

It was kinda hard to keep up with her, even though she was walking at a perfectly normal pace.

1382,CasualConversation,I accomplished a lot of personal things in the past year!,"No, I didn’t accomplish anything related to a career, or get married, or jump from dating one person to another right away, or any of the “cool” things to do as an adult, the way dressing well or liking top 40 music is cool in high school...


...but here’s what I did:

1. Went from 150 to 121 pounds at 5’1.
2. Made lots of art.
3. Did lots of yard work over the summer, and spent more time outdoors in the summer than I probably have in any previous year.
4. Got a dog, a cute floofy one!
5. Learned a whole bunch of Spanish.
6. Hit a record with reps lifting weights (100 curls even though they were only 5-pound weights)
7. Cut back by about 95 percent on buying clothes and shoes, not including second-hand. If you include second-hand, still probably cut back about 50 percent.

Did you accomplish anything personal? Tell me about it! Don’t hold back!",Fantastic-Judgment-2,1641590042

1384,CasualConversation,My parents are breaking my hear,"My parents are breaking my heart

So I (20F) am a third year college student who had her entire second year ripped away by Covid. Last quarter we were back in person and it was so fun. This quarter because of omicron is is starting online but I’m back on campus. And I feel so depressed. I feel lonely and hurt and in pain all the time. I’m realizing how a lot of the relationships I created were just people who will always prefer other people over me. 

My parents can tell when I’m sad and it breaks my heart. Because they call me and I know they know and I try my best to stay upbeat but they just know and I don’t know how they know. I’m lucky my parents are in a very good financial position and I know how much they love me but it breaks my heart because I know how much they must be in pain that they can’t help me. They can’t help that everything is online again and that I’m depressed again. I get good grades, I’ll graduate next year and have a good job, but I feel so miserable and unloved at college. I do have friends but a lot of them aren’t back yet or have boyfriends etc and it’s just hard. I joined clubs last quarter too to keep myself socially busy and it was great honestly. I partied, hung out w friends after classes etc. but now that everything is online AGAIN it’s so hard. And my parents still call every day and I can hear their hearts breaking and I swear it breaks my heart. 

My dad today offered to buy me a TV for my apartment for me and all my roommates so we can watch together and I won’t be lonely and I don’t want a TV, obviously what I want money cant buy, but it made me cry because I know he’s legit trying the best he can and I don’t want to take his money and get a TV. Also my roommates have boyfriends so it’s like im the only oen whos realky alone ans I can’t force ppl to hang out w me. I don’t want a TV. I just want my parents to be happy because even tho I’m not hapoy I want them to be hapoy. I can tell they’re trying so hard but what can they do. What can I do ?",PleaseNeverLetMeGo,1641589570

Did you know that more than 50% of the world population speaks at least two languages? And yet people like me struggle when it comes to writing effectively in our second language, especially for work related tasks.

As a computer science person, I plan to  develop a web application for professional bilingual writers using artificial intelligence. Besides grammar check and translation, the application will help rephrasing some text for a landing page, a title suggestion for a blog site, providing taglines for an ad, recommending SEO keywords for a website, copywriting for a product description, explaining a complicated scientific article, etc. 

Do you think this is a good idea? Are you a bilingual person? If yes, what kind of problem would you like the application solve?",data-gig,1641587669

1399,CasualConversation,"I love listening to people, and hate speaking. That is apparently not normal","I recently found out from my mother that people love to speak, and they love to be heard significantly more than they enjoy listening.

That came as a shock to me, as I've always hated speaking. I once even made a challenge to not speak for 3 days straight, and nobody noticed. That's how quiet I usually am, and I'm fine with that

People always have such interesting things to say. Even when people are educating me on celebrity names and nonsensical slang, it's always interesting to learn something new.

As for speaking, I stuggle to think of ways to put my thoughts into words, and that often leads to weird pauses and frustrating stutters. 

A side effect is that I think so hard about how to say something, that I don't think about what I should say next. What ends up happening is I finish my sentence and the other person expects me to continue, but I've run out of things to say. It's klunky and boring, and even when it goes right, it's not nearly as fun as listening to someone telling a story.

As a result of all this I've become pretty good at asking questions. Questions are usually pretty short and invite the other person to speak even more. That way the other person gets to talk, I get to listen, and we're both happy!",Skunko,1641585063

One of her's was, ""Ohh yeah we got him to help us blow up balloons for a poster thing so she could keep one. Some of us think she breathed it to ""share his breath"" but you know how it is when you're crushing."" I'm paraphrasing a bit to shorten the story but... what?

They live in Thunder Bay (Ontario, Canada) and I live in Ottawa (Ontario, Canada)

So, we planned it and I drove 1600 kms (not at once, I stayed Wednesday night in a hotel just past the halfway point.  Sidenote; first time I've driven a distance like this, by myself)

So, I got here yesterday around noon. My sister and I hung out for an hour or so and then decided to go surprise our mom then, rather than wait until Saturday.

Another note; I haven't seen either of them since I got married in 2016 and my MIL paid for their flights because as she said ""you need tour mom and sister there"" I love my MIL

Anyway, we go to Mt moms and my sister knocks on the door. (I was hiding off to the side) Mom answers and sister says ""On, there's a surprise here for you"". We don't think she really head because she was telling sister to close the door. 

So, I pop into the doorway and our mom stares for a second (I think processing lol) screams my name and gives me a rib cracking hug. I was like, you're not gonna have a heart attack, are you? She said she just might, but will cry instead lol

We then took her out for a big grocery shop (she lives alone and is on a limited income). I wanted her to get enough stuff to last a while. Meats she could freeze, canned goods etc etc. Then tool her to the pet store to load up on cat food/litter

Cost more than I planned (oh well) but she said the stuff should last her 2 months. And that was the point.

Now, it's my sister's birthday today and I was gonna take her out to get something before relaxing until dinner at our moms tomorrow.

When we talk to someone for the first time we try to paint a picture in our minds of who they are based on everything we can assume about them based on clues we get. This may ultimate be accurate, but at the same time it will never be 100% true since we're using our own set of markers to fill in the colors which are flawed by our biases.

I work in a small company of maybe 15-20 employees and often read about how companies that say they see their employees as family is a lie to abuse workers, and in my case it couldn’t be further from the truth. 

I see the owner a couple times a week (which is 4 days for us, and I speak to him anytime I need to) and when times are tough he is right out there doing the dirtiest of work. Is he as good at it as the people who were trained for it and do it every (work)day? No. But the fact that he doesn’t see himself as above doing the low-level work that’s guaranteed to ruin whatever you’re wearing is a serious plus in my book. 

Not only that but I work with the actual funniest people I’ve met in my life. Sometimes the work sucks and we all bitch about it, but in general it’s just nonstop jokes and poking at each other in my job and I love it.

It sucks because unless something serious changes I know I won’t be here for more than a couple of years (because I just want to do more with my life and make more money), but I really do enjoy my current work environment. I wonder if coming up with enough new ideas and innovating the company will propel me to where I want to be financially while letting me stay here will be enough, but I also feel that the company is in kind of a good spot where most people are generally okay and there is certainly a lot of love for each and every employee.",forgothatdamnpasswrd,1641565383

1461,CasualConversation,I just don't seem to belong anywhere - tips on dealing,"Hi everyone, 

  
So I've been going through a pretty hard time the past few months due to a growing feeling of not belonging anywhere, which has been intensified by working from home (new job) and not having the opportunity to really see and meet people during the day. 

I live in France but come from the UK so the majority of my close friends are not with me and the ones I had in France are slowly but surely moving away. I have close friends but there isn't necessarily a group I fit into and it seems now that I just constantly stay as the outsider as even my close friends have their own groups and lives formed.

It's hard as I love being around people and it feels uncomfortable to not have a place I can really call home and mean it. It just feels like I'm constantly floating, it honestly feels like I'm a plastic bag, drifting through the wind, Katy Perry's song finally makes sense!

I'm in a good relationship and my boyfriend has insisted on the fact that I always have a place of belonging with him and while that's nice to hear, it just doesn't feel true because I don't want to rely on him for a sense of belonging, what if we break up? He comes from Italy, and while his family and friends are nice, there's a language barrier and cultural barrier that keeps me feeling like an outsider. I'm trying to learn but I want to have my own sense of belonging. 

As I get older, it gets to the point where I ask myself: if I have a wedding, will people actually show up? For a birthday celebration, will people actually show up? Do I have friends to go on vacation with? 

I never thought about this type of thing when I was younger, I moved around a lot and was loving life that constantly changed and wasn't stable. But now as I'm older, all I want is to have a sense of community around me and to feel like I have a place to belong and call home. Even to have people around me who know little updates about my life like something that happened when I was on my bike. Basic stuff like that. 

Anyway, I'm posting this as I want to feel that I'm not alone in this feeling. Do any of you feel like this? If so, how do you manage it?",biggatyboom,1641553833
1462,CasualConversation,"I've decided to finish my degree, after 10 years","(Disclaimer: this is not in the USA)

When I enrolled in 2012 to an IT bachelor, I was a very timid and bullied boy. While I made lots of progress profesionally and personally during this college time, I had trouble studying. I never had to do anything for school in high school etc, so this became an issue during college.  

While I inevitably lagged behind my friends, I was forced to go to new classes since they moved on, friendships slowly drifted away and couples in the friendship circle broke up and moved away. I was left alone in my final year(s) of college and I became severely depressed.

Due to this, I never finished my degree. However without this, I was able to get a job in IT as a developer. Several years have passed now and my life is... Better at least. Not great, not where I want it, but improving. I've made new contacts in real life, socially, I've an SO for some years now and profesionaly I'm rising the ranks from junior ""i don't know anything"" developer to medior ""I can get stuff done and help people"" etc. I feel more confident now too.  

After all this time, I want to not just waste the rest of my time gaming all the time. While I don't see gaming in such a negative light as many others, It can become a problem is it's a thing I do ""just to waste"" time you know. I could be learning, improving in different ways, and still waste time gaming occassionally. I feel like I could do more with my life. Since I'm older now, these questions start popping up more, since I have an SO, thinking about buying a house, making kids, how am I going to raise them If I can't even convince myself to improve myself, etc etc...

So, 10 years later than I started my degree, I'm going to dedicate myself to finishing it this year, since I only have like 2-3 courses left and it's actually a shame I'm not finishing it...  

So here goes! To improving yourself and learning!",horoblast,1641553104

She always makes sure I realize when friends aren't being friends, even when I tell her I don't really mind it, she just goes ""No, you should mind it. You can't let people treat you like this.""

She told me ""You're a really good person, and you have such a kind heart and its really obvious but that doesn't mean you should let everything slip.

1507,CasualConversation,My husband's ex called and said she couldn't make it to her house so I invited her to come stay at our house and shoveled the driveway for her. She didn't show up.,"She and my husband share a child, my step son. SS lives with us full time. Mom gets to visit at our house so I'm used to having her over. She's stayed here before when times were tough and there's no animosity between us. 

When she called and said she was stuck at work I just extended the invitation naturally. She drives a small car so I figured I'd shovel the drive to make it as easy as possible for her. I shoveled the walk as well, because I don't like things to be incomplete. 

Meanwhile, my husband (hes a leg amputee)and SS, who is 12, stayed in the house and watched Harry Potter while myself and my 8 year old daughter did all the shoveling. 

I was really proud of my daughter for coming to help. I didn't ask for help at all. I was a little hurt that my husband and SS didn't offer to help at all after my daughter got dressed and helped. 

My SS came outside and brought me a pair of gloves, then went back in and continued watching his movie with his dad while waiting for his mom. 

I would have shoveled the drive anyway tomorrow, so it's not like I did anything extra, but it kinda stings to know that they'd just let us do all the work and not really put any effort into helping us, or helping the ex/mom. 

She decided not to come and just stay at work which I get. It was a simple solution and she's guaranteed overtime cuz very few people will show up for the early morning shift. 

Idk. I guess I just kinda feel useless, I didn't actually help anyone and kinda got crapped on in the process is what it feels like.

I stayed there for a day and felt like it was too lonely out there, without messy apartment mates. 
Then I shifted back to my old apartment and felt like it's too messy to live here and now am in a dilemma.

1515,CasualConversation,Realised I broke out of depression today!," 

Hello!

My 2021 was not a great year for me. I lost a 4-year relationship in the winter, got into another far too fast in January, broke up again, took a substantial amount of LSD, ketamine, MDMA and weed in a 5-month streak, vowed to quit them and started a research position for the summer, quit after 2 months, developed depression and had to file for a year's break from my master's course in university.

I will never forget just how difficult depression is. For most of my life I viewed it as a persistent low mood state, maybe you feel a bit shit? Have some chocolate? Put on a movie? You'll be fine.

I didn't realise it stripped me of who I was. I couldn't speak to people or hold a conversation. I lay in bed every day doing nothing to try to feel comfortable. I became bitter and couldn't sleep. I stopped exercising, reading, listening to music, eating, drinking. My friends knew something was wrong but there was just a glassy-eyed stranger staring back at them, trying to think of something, anything, to say. Fuck friends. I want to sleep but I can't.

I talked to a therapist and have been slowing down my life over the past 3 months. I'm in the lucky position to be able to take a break from university and simply live in a flat by myself.

I've realised some major things about myself and thankfully really ""feel"" like me again. It's almost as if I've captured and controlled all the areas of my brain again, does that make sense? I talked to my ex for hours today. I've been to parties where I can have fun again, I can enjoy weed in moderation.  

When you're depressed you are not yourself.

Time helps, talking helps.

Thank you for everything and all the advice I scrolled through in the darkest, most uncomfortable period of my life.

Never take for granted proper mental health I suppose!

Cheers from Scotland.",tempyroller,1641529018

I can do a lot of other things like improving my learning skills, wash clothes and dishes, feed my baby, take care of my plants etc in between work during at home. 

Now I am back at work in the office after 2 years since 1 Jan, Reddit addiction crept back in. I lurk into reddit even 5 minutes break in between meetings.

1520,CasualConversation,Do I fly to Europe from SE Asia?,"Hey all! I hope all of you had a great day :)

I recently graduated high school! For the last year and a half I've worked my butt off to be able to afford a 6 month trip in SE Asia alone, and I did it! It was a lot of hard work, and my mental health really took a toll, but I think this trip will be a defining moment in my life.

Now the issue.... I have my ticket booked and everything, but my cousin in Poland is having his communion (which I have known of). My parents and sister are all flying there in May to celebrate, and they want me to come. 

Originally, I thought about going! I thought it would be a great experience and I would be able to adventure around Europe until June. But then I started to do a little research and found that Europe is incredibly expensive compared to SE Asia.

I was scared off, but eventually they told me they would pay for my return ticket to the us (they aren't paying a single penny for this 6 month adventure of mine) so I started thinking....

When budgeting SE Asia for 6 months (flights and all expenses included) I came to about 9-10,000 on the high end. Now this would leave me (as of currently) 8,000 in my savings account. 

And because I plan on starting college in the fall semester, I do not want to burn through all that money.

Now the plan for Europe would be about an extra month or two, but IDK

I need someones advice and input!

Sorry if this is written super poorly.... I'm currently in traffic and just need to speak my mind.

Since I'm on break, it would be a decent time to try it. I am a distance student, so there isn't much opportunity to talk to others at my university.

Some things I enjoy

I love reading, especially history - I prefer nonfiction. I also like philosophy, sociology, criminal psychology, and biology. I like classical music. I love biographies and some documentaries on history and famous people. I like reading famous quotations, and I think it would be nice to have someone to share good sayings with (this is unnecessary though). I like getting myself educated, whether it's in school or by myself. I am also studying a few languages by myself for fun. Also many people say they watch too much TV, but I watch too much YouTube. Some things I don't care much for (but we can still talk even if you do; in general, I'd like if we had some interests in common since it makes the conversations more engaging):

* Sports
* Television

A few things I admire:

I admire people who like math, since I'm not much good at it. I value people who can write long messages, and don't like ghosting.

I'm not a fan of small talk but you can start a conversation any way you want, works for me! Do you have favorite quotes? Who are your role models? What are your hobbies? What are your favorite things? Good luck with your new year! And I look forward to talking to you!",historyleopard,1641523145
1526,CasualConversation,What is the true purpose of life?,"Thinking of it you just want to stop with everything, go wild and start living, filling the emptiness in your gut just because you feel like you're depressed but the point is you don't feel anything at all. You're just empty. You need a rest as Jim Carrey says. Your body needs a rest from all the bullshit you've dealt with and all the fake moments you've had just to present a character. Your body is not you. You just try to control your body in order to look good, be successful in other's eyes, play, play, play. This needs to stop at one point. Building a character, feeling the urge to make a difference, to feel special. Earn money from the thing you like the most or the thing you don't like at all, a regular job or a project, a bussiness. You need to succeed, you feel like you need to make it happen. In the first part of your life you just feel like you need to do something in order to be significant, successful but at the same time you know that when the time comes you will drop all the shit you've built so you can rest a bit. Do we even need to go through this long way so we can reach the point where you just say to yourself fuck it, I'm done? Why do we need it? Is it ego? Is it the selfish part deeply inside us that wants us to be successful in the eyes of others? Is this us? Just stop and look around. Ask yourself about the moments that make you happy. Or you are depressed and sad? Yes you are just because you need a break from everything. The hard moment of realising the fucking truth is when everything is emptiness and you feel like you don't even want to continue living in this world. You are not needed here. You don't need this world anymore because you've had enough of it. Are you trying to fill the void because there are no such things that make you happy anymore? Yes, there were moments in which you felt like a child, having the best experience in your life but do they make you feel good? No, because you forget about these moments. And if you don't do anything to create another moments you won't be able to fill the emptiness in your soul. You just live in the matrix and everyday is the same. You wake up, eat, do some activity, check your social media for a large part of the day and then sleep. This cycle is inevitable. If you try to break it people start wondering what the fuck is wrong with you. Buy a fucking caravan just to explore the nature? Alone? With a friend? Are you out of your goddamn mind? Snap back to reality and stop dreaming. This is your life. You stare at the screen and try to figure out what I'm trying to tell you. If you don't like it anymore you close the tab and continue scrolling in tik-tok or instagram or whatever app you're using, trying to find something. But you don't even know what are you searching for. Why are we here on this Earth? Why are we in those bodies? Should we try to avoid our ego in order to reach the almighty energy after we die? If we try to avoid our ego this means we shouldn't be having kids. Because our ego says that our kids will have our genes which are better genes than other people's. Think about it. We have the right to think. We are not animals living on autopilot. This means we should think. Who are we? Why do we say ""My hand"", ""My arm"", ""My head"". Who are you if you have a body? Who is the person inside of you? Why are we not having discussions about that more often, why are we trying to find the truth about us just for a few moments and then stop? You've been thinking about those things months ago. What made you search the truth once again? Trying to break out of the matrix and find the real purpose of life? Yeah me too.

1) me: how do you go for so many outings and parties all the time? 
A: I don’t know, people just invite me? 

2) me: how do you make your friends remember your birthday and remember to buy you present? 

B: how can you “make” people remember to buy you present? I don’t! 

Me: then how come you can get so many? 

B: huh? because they are my friends? Friends will remember birthday. 

3) me: you know, (friends name) and (friends name) all had their friends plan a surprise birthday for them? Like their friends just naturally remember their birthday and naturally buy a cake for them? SO GOOD! 

C: huh? Isn’t that normal? Friends will do this kind of thing for birthday right? 

Me; so it’s normal to everyone? It’s a regular occurrence where your friend surprise you? But how to make your friend surprise you with a present? 

C: huh? What’s there to force about this kind of thing? 

Me: if don’t ask or remind also can have? 

C: it’s natural. Not ask or remind. 

4) me: how do you get so many notes, cards and presents from everyone? Like so much??? 

D: huh? Is people want to give me then they give.

Me: I see that so many of the notes are so touching. You cried after reading them. How to feel so touched until you cry? (Pardon the bad phrasing) 

D: this kind of things cannot teach. Is feeling. I from young is can. How to teach you? 

Me: I also want to feel so touched that u cry but I don’t know how it feels like. 

D: huh? but I cannot teach you how to have feelings. You cannot then you cannot. 

5) me: how to watch a movie and feel so touched until you cry? I also want to know how feeling touched feels like but I don’t have.

E: is a feeling from the inside. You cannot make yourself have it because it’s supposed to be natural. 

Me: but we should try hard to get it right? How do I work had to feel something? From what age did you begin to feel something?

E: huh? since young? When someone does something nice for you and you will feel it? 

Me: then what if nobody does anything? How do I make them do something? 

E: I didn’t make them do something, they automatically do. 

6) me: how come so many girls can carry branded handbags and purses everywhere? Like where does all that money even come from?! 

F: huh? Isn’t it normal? You talking about Guess, or Charles and Keith? Aren’t these “ENTRY LEVEL” Brand’s? 

Me: it’s around 100 bucks each wallet and bag. They just spend like this? How is this “entry level”? 

F: the really expensive ones are from Chanel or Gucci. 

Me; yeah, these cost $5000 each. But how come so many other people can buy all of them? For you, do you feel very happy and grateful that everything you own is Chanel, LV, or Prada? 

F: I don’t feel anything. It’s normal to me. 

Everyone is so innocent. Huh? I don’t know. Huh? I didn’t do anything. Huh? I never work hard. I don’t study at all. I don’t put in effort. Huh? I never lift a finger and I get so many things. My life is just naturally all about receiving and not giving!

Recently I've been having strong desires that I wish she was actually a guy so I could marry her. In my house, my mom is the head and boss. I told my friend for fun that if she was a guy and we married, she'd have to give in to me and follow what I said (for most of the time).

I feel like any job that I get wouldn’t be enough for me because no matter what I try I get bored eventually. I try lots of things for a while but they never stick. It feels like I’m a jack of all trades master of none. The only reason I like YouTube so much is because I can do whatever I want and it also includes computers which I have a talent for. Basically I have zero idea what I want to do because YouTube requires lots of luck but it’s the only thing I like doing.",radiantstuckiniron,1641518307

People were quite impressed and wanted to feel my chest and muscles. Except when someone felt my abs I squirmed away because I am very ticklish there. My friend commented ""All his ticklish spots are exposed now.""

I spent the rest of the lesson avoiding people's tickles as even a light touch tickled when I wasn't wearing a shirt.

1541,CasualConversation,I feel lucky I was a teenager before smartphones.,"I’m an 80s baby, 90s kid, 00s teen. I graduated from college the exact year the first smartphone came out.

Before anyone’s lives depended on the Internet, people looked to their immediate surroundings for what they need in life. Less digital, more physical.

Interacting with physical things felt more real than digital things, for obvious reasons. My relationships, the things I used, what I experienced have been what was near me.

My most important years, my growth during puberty, had been in an era where it was more comfy and cozy to be a human. Analog things were still in use and tangible. I remember as a kid I’ve written letters and sent them out via postal mail! It’s crazy to think that now.

I was able to talk and make friends, connections, much easier because they felt more real. Everyone HAD to make an effort to do anything. Things had more substance.

I thank technology for the ease and convenience, but I’m sad at what it perhaps have cost us.",BeardedGlass,1641517858

I want to create a list of new resolutions, challenges, experiences and things that I should try/see/do/know or meet in order to have a very excited and incredible life. I don't want to make a list for one year, but I want to make one for a lifetime!

I've been researching, looking and thinking a lot about what I would love to do, try, see and live before I die, and so far I've made a list of #1,898 points, I would like to get to #2,000 just to leave it in a closed number, so... I need help thinking about 100 more things. 

As you may already imagine with #1,898 points, basic things like: jumping from a plane (skydiving), travel the world (in more details), learn a new language, write a book... are already in my list, so I want to ask for your help in diferent, crazier, unthinkable, out of this world ideas. Help me discover those things I might be missing in life, it doesn't matter how simple, short or insignificant they might seem. Everything is acceptable!

If you come up with something, feel free to let me know, I'll certainly love to hear your ideas. (Travel is a very wide area, so if you know of a place in specific that would be cool to know, feel free to write it down).

I would really appreciate your help, and I thank you beforehand! If you feel curious about my list and want to try making their own list, I can share it with you (maybe I can share some ideas of my list with you too). I hope somehow my list can inspire you to get  busy and create yours as well, I assure it is really fun.

1547,CasualConversation,"For the first time in idk how long, I actually had a nice dream","It was actually more like a memory. It was of course about my dad who I recently lost. And, because of the amount of stress and grief I’d been under recently, I tended to have really stressful dreams and sometimes full-on nightmares. Just your usual stuff like being chased by someone and basically running in place lol. Or falling.

What happened in the dream in question was the following: It’s like I was a cameraman and was pointing at my front door. It’s dark out and my dad walks in, wearing his usual dark green work shirt and boots he’s seemingly owned since I was a baby. He of course looks exhausted like he always did when he worked long nights and takes his boots off, setting them by the door. I’m there (probably at least 12 or 13 as I could tell) asleep on the couch like I often was because I’d fall asleep playing video games or watching a show. He sees me and gives an exhausted sigh but then musters what strength he has and picks me up and carries me up to my room. He gently puts me down in my bed, kisses my head and says “‘Night baby” and leaves.

And that was it. Whole thing felt like only 10 seconds yet I woke up and a few hours had passed. But it was nice to wake up happy. A bit sad, knowing it was just a dream. But it was better than nothing. Like I said, I had to have been in middle school or just leaving elementary because of the pajamas I had on that my grandma made for me.

What I’ve always loved most about my dad is that I never felt like I was a burden. That, even though my mom left when I was a baby, he never took his understandable anger and frustration out on me. Sure I was annoying and downright manipulative at times, and we’d have plenty of shouting matches, but we always came back to each other. I needed him and he needed me, truly. I’ve never felt more safe and secure than when he was around, no matter what mood I was in. And that’s how that dream made me feel: safe and secure.",user_iteration,1641515851

1550,CasualConversation,Reasons to be a grocery store bagger,"I'm about to sell you on this job. Ready?

1. Customers appreciate and respect you, and let you know. I get thanked *all the time* by *everyone*. Some customers have disabilities or bought a lot of food and need help out to their car, and it's extremely fulfilling to help them. I love the little things like noticing that they bought ingredients for cake, and asking them what kind. ""Oh! My grandson is staying with us for the winter, and his birthday is tomorrow, I don't see him often but I want to give him something special."" I LOVE IT SO MUCH.

 Another time, a woman saw me struggling with carts (lol) and helped me line them up. I didn't ask. I'd been running around the parking lot for like half an hour in the heat collecting carts. Small things like that make it worth it. 

2. You get free food sometimes if they like your service. Piggybacking off of the first point. Maybe it's pity, maybe it's Maybelline. Who cares!!!!!!! Just today a lady paid for a bottle of DD coffee, and decided that I could have it because she had a huge cart and bagging it all was quite some work. Another time some guy gave me candy for absolutely no reason. It was odd but I ain't gonna question it. 

3. You're busy all day. Pushing carts, running around for various reasons, driving those ride carts back into the store, putting back stuff that customers didn't want/getting them more of something they already bought because it's a BOGO. You're on your feet all day. Yeah it's a little sucky.

1551,CasualConversation,Vampires exist in a quantum space.,"So this popped into my head the other day on my drive home.
I was perusing Skyrim mods while waiting to move my car forward another inch, and I saw a mod that makes vampires not cast shadows, and it got me thinking.

I had heard the shadow thing before, and it's a common instance in the vampire mythos that they do not have reflections.
Both shadows and reflections are reliant on light bouncing off of an object.

Now the lack of shadow is what I want to focus on for this first post, since the light doesn't bounce off of the vampire, I would think the light just passes through them; and since vampires are not clear or transparent, I would suggest they just don't interact with the light at all.

It is my theory that vampires could be incorporeal, and only gain physicality when they are interacting with something that could cognitively perceive that they are interacting with a vampire, specifically via touch.",Blackheart252,1641514290

1555,CasualConversation,I'm stuck in the past,"Bit of a sob story so sorry in advance. I don't really have alot of friends to talk too so i've come here in hopes that someone will listen. 

I have one ''friend''..... I use '' because we've grown apart over the years. As all friendships do. But now I'm left with no one. We can go months and months at a time of not talking to eachother. And then randomly, either me or her will message one another out of the blue.

 Lately i've been feeling really down. I really struggle with my mental health. And I just needed someone to talk too, just to be around someone that I'm comfortable with instead of pretending to be someone I'm not and putting on a brave face every single day in work. I messaged her telling her about how I was feeling lately and the vibes just didn't feel right anymore. She now talks to me completely different. Like as if she just met me and I'm a stranger. Very formal sounding. Usually we make silly jokes and text in a funny way. 

I just kinda sat back and realized how much we've grown apart. She's now a fully grown adult. She moved country a few years ago with her boyfriend to start her career as a nurse, she has her own apartment, pays rents, pays her own bills. It's just crazy to me to think that is the same person I've known since we were both 5 years old. And I know, this is called being a adult but to me. It all just seems surreal because i'm stuck in the past. I haven't moved anywhere in my life in the past 10 years because of my crappy mental health. Still in the same town i grew up in. Never went to college. Work in retail with a bunch of teenagers making minimum wage. Barely enough to live on. Half of it goes to my parents anyway for putting up with me for so long. I never got to go travelling or see the world. I've always waited for her to bring me along. She's been to Africa, America now she's going on a hike across Europe in the Spring. Can i come?? I just want to get out of this town and this country for a small break. I asked her if she would like to come on a small holiday with me and obviously, because I wasn't thinking. We're not teenagers anymore. She has responsibility's now. The obvios answer was no. I can't. I have a job and i have bills to pay and rent to pay. Duhhhh! How can i be so stupid?? 

 I miss the past. I'm always thinking about all the things we did growing up. How we could go anywhere we liked without having to worry about anything. The only friends I have right now are my elderly parents and my 2 dogs. And yes, I still live at home with my parents and to make it sound even more pathetic, I'm about to be 30. I've sort of grown used to be being alone that whenever my mom gets at me to go out and make some friends in work, I laugh about it and tell her how I don't really care anymore because I'm so used to being alone now. True to an extent but I think we all need friends. Just someone to talk too, hang out with, laugh with. It's healthy. And my parents are not going to be around forever. I've now taken on the full time job of taking care of them including working my own full time job so I'm pretty exhausted at the end of the night.",Adorable_Bee_4216,1641512754

I’m a man. I learnt from the beginning of my life to never really show my emotions or any vulnerability. Even when I was in an abusive relationship where she screamed at me, insulted me and hit me nearly every day. Yes, I was a head taller. No, it didn’t hurt. Yes, I could’ve defended myself. But I didn’t. I’m not like that. But I suffered in silence, because telling people about my pain was just an invitation for empty words or, worse, ridicule. I couldn’t take it anymore and tried to end it. That was yesterday, one year ago.

Somehow I’m still alive. I got away from her. I learnt to open up about my emotions through extensive therapy and antidepressants. I’m continuing university, started my own business, now have amazing friends who support me in every struggle and I met someone new. Someone who understands and let’s me be weak. When I told her about my past, her reaction was to hug me and hold me for hours. I never believed that people could ever be so amazing. I’ve never been happier in my whole life, one year later. Thank god I didn’t succeed.

1577,CasualConversation,"At first I felt sort of unfriendly, but then I felt validated","So, late last year, someone new arrived at the place where I work, although not in my group.  Several times, seemingly out of the blue, this person said hi to me in passing.  It may not seem like much, but I'm used to being essentially invisible except to people I work directly with, so I repaid the friendliness.  They seem like a nice, if soft-spoken person.

After the introduction, I noticed that I crossed paths with them most mornings, by dint of that fact that we arrived to work at the same time (same mass transit).  Each time, we'd have a short, polite, and friendly chat before starting our work day, which included both of us asking questions about the other (i.e. trying to get to know each other).  However, other than that, this person person basically ignored me at other times of the day.  Odd contrast.

You can explain a little of this by shyness, but after a month of it, it dawned on me how awkward this felt; what if they were just politely chatting in the morning for no other reason than to continue the politeness?  I resolved to quietly eliminate the interaction by showing up earlier at work.  Worked perfectly.

As I did this, it occurred to me it might be a rather cold or impersonal way to deal with someone.  But this week I've noticed incidentally that they have also shifted their arrival consistently *later*.   Of course there's no proof (and I'm not going to dig into it), but I feel validated that maybe they invented the same scheme to step out of an unneeded morning social interaction. Ha! :)

So I've been dating with a girl for 2 months who I really like. Lucky for me, she's expressed those same feelings as well. She's super into sports and running her first half a marathon this Sunday. The actual event has been cancelled due to covid. But she's running it unofficially on her own now with a friend.

So I was thinking about getting her a personalized engraved medal with her name+the distance+the date on it. It's not expensive or anything, but I thought it might be nice for her to have a physical object to remember her off the time she first ran half a marathon. 

So the idea is basically to surprise her and put it over neck as she reaches the finish.

I got so used to it especially during the pandemic and it didn’t bother me at all. I never felt like something was missing. In august i started getting close with a coworker who wasnt at all my type. And i wasn’t attracted to him romantically because i thought there was 0 comparability. But he kept texting and showing a lot of interest and i decided to go for it. It had been 2 years of being alone so i thought it would be nice having someone. It was the worst decision ever. It ruined me for 5 months. He liked me and appreciated me but not the way i craved. The relationship was shallow and i nevwr felt a deep connection. But i got addicted to his company. And kept staying together and fighting and just being unhappy. We finally broke it off and im so broken not over hum byt over the fact that ive never had someone i truly loved and connected with.,eyeeyecaptainn,1641504801
1586,CasualConversation,I think I found the person I want to spend the rest of my life with,"We hang out without necessarily doing the same thing together. We give each other space to be alone. We laugh and goof at each other. She teaches me life-stuff that I've never thought about bc I'm a weirdo lol, and encourages me to be myself and worry less. When I'm with her I don't feel butterflies, but I feel serene and calm. Yesterday in the early morning as the sun was rising, I watched her fall asleep on my lap on the sofa and I just felt this ""wow"", that I found someone that makes me so happy. It's a calm assuring stability that just... it's so cute. I can't tell yet if it will last, but I want to put in the effort. I read somewhere that the most successful relationships are the ones where you pay attention to the other person and share those moments of connection. If your partner points out a bird, don't ignore it, take the moment and look at the bird and share their excitement with them. I just wanted to share, and hope you have a great day.

1609,CasualConversation,I miss her,"I'm not gonna lie, this New Years has been interesting and unfortunately, not in the good way my title makes it seem. It kinda sucks that as a guy, you can't really speak out to others about what's going on emotionally within me but hopefully I can speak freely here.


Ever since the New Years has started, even on the first day of the year. I had a dream about a girl from my past. I've always had a distrust of people due to bad experiences, and living in a bad neighborhood. But she was the first where I started to let my guard down. Throughout highschool, and into college, we would be friends. There was even a point where I started having romantic feeling for her and let her know. She had them back too.


But due to how stupid and emotionally immature I was, we would be on and off with our friendship since I couldn't easily accept that there's someone, that's getting close to me. And she was so patient with me, you wouldn't believe. We then started college together and we would stick together and the feeling of having someone that was right there next to you, for almost 6 years now, was just a feeling that I loved so much. But the damn conflict that I had with myself,  I just couldn't shake these bad habits.


Eventually, I made the stupidest decision I could. I pushed her away. I knew what made her mad and so I went for it. I went too far and the friendship ended. My stupid decision, my absolutely stupid decision of ending the friendship on bad terms, now eats me up. Almost 6 years ago since I forced a bad end, and it haunts me. From time to time, I would dream that she would come up to me, smile and say she forgives me. I would wake up feeling empty, depressed, and just nostalgic about the times we would laugh together. 


Ever since this year started, I've had back to back dreams of her. Usually of her just looking at me, smiling, and accepting to be friends again. Last night, I dreamt that we were sitting together on the bus,  she had the sun illuminating her face, and I could feel her shoulder on my shoulder, something that she would do when we would walk together.  That warmth, that moment of letting her into my personal space, felt so nice, so damn nice. Who knew waking up could be so painful at times.


I miss her, I never would admit to missing someone, but I miss her. I miss her smile, her laugh, her texts. It was nice having a friend that was there with me for so long. I wish her the best. I wish I could've been her friend, but with emotional and mental maturity that I believe I have now. I probably sound stupid and emotional going off dreams, dreams which probably reflect my regret, she would probably be weirded out by this too. But it feels great now admitting it to the the world, or who ever reads this.

I have just graduated from my master's degree and got a government job. I don't make too much now, but in the future I will probably make six figures. Eventually, I do intend to start a business, he may be my business partner, I may have the business by myself. That's at least 10-15 years in the future, so I don't have all of the information figured out. I also have about $150,000 in student loans (which should be forgiven in ten years from the PSLF). 

He is about to graduate from his bachelor's degree in either December 2022 or May 2023, his industry is booming and we expect for him to find a job quickly, that'll probably make about the same that I make. Later in his career he will probably make six figures as well. He has about $30,000 in student loans, but the PSLF won't be available to him.

We plan to buy a house together once he gets a job after graduating. We will split all expenses down the middle, we will keep our funds separately, file taxes separately, etc. We will not have any children. 

I want to get a prenup that protects him from my student loans, me from his student loans, that decides what we'll do with our jointly owned home if we get divorced.

1630,CasualConversation,I'm telling a guy I like him next week - I'm scared sh*tless and I love how alive it makes me feel.,"I (20F) made the mistake of getting a little too attached to someone for a little too long. I've liked him for (ouch) three years, but that's okay - I won't let that intimidate me. He's cute and he's really smart (and so am I!) so I want to give it a shot.

I want to keep this little story vague, so I'll just say there have been a couple interactions hinting at the possibility that he \*might\* like me back after all.

Still, I won't get my hopes up. I'll be calm and direct to the point; I'll acknowledge that this is sudden and reassure him that I don't expect anything in return, and that I just wanted to let him know because I think he deserves it. I'll avoid mentioning how long it's been unless he asks because I don't want to freak him out.

I know some of you might tell me to ask him out instead of telling him I have a crush on him - don't worry, I live in the Philippines and we're a real romantic bunch hahaha so whenever we find someone interesting romantically, it's not unusual for us to essentially confess to them and take it from there. Asking someone out on a date is actually weirder because we don't really go out on dates with people we're not already involved with. So, there's that. It's culturally acceptable to just bite the bullet and experience the rush of emotions in one go. 

He's not the type to be harsh, but people can be unpredictable, so I'll prepare for the worst. I ordered cute clothes this week so I'll have something to either console or congratulate myself with, depending on the outcome. I'll buy myself ice cream and watch an hour-long concert. I'll watch a few Disney films. I'll feel shitty for a week, but I'll move on.

If he reciprocates, I'll be kind to him. If he doesn't, I'll be kind to myself and \*not\* take this as a sign that I'm unworthy of love. I deserve to be liked back, and it doesn't have to come from him. Still, I want to try.

Anyway, I'm scared shitless! I love it though - the nerves are refreshing. I'm here. I'm alive. I'm about to tell someone that I admire his diligence, that I think he's interesting, and that he has great taste in horror movies. Whatever the outcome, I'll get to experience those big feelings again. 

It's going to be...a human experience. Wish me luck!

They said that I have been showing great potential and was the first person they tought of when one of the teams members announced she is leaving the position. 

I am really excited because this is a pretty serious step up from my current job and something that will actualy look good on my resume and as a reference in the future + I will gain a huge amount of important experience dealing with the EU regulations and projects!

1636,CasualConversation,Let's talk about depersonalization,"This is something that's been kicking around in my head and I figured I'll just put it here.  A little bit of background about me is that I used to be a teacher up until about three months ago.  I tried returning to teaching after quarantining and I just couldn't do it anymore, my spark for it wasn't there.  This, in turn, lead me on a bit of an existential trip because unfortunately, I defined a tremendous amount of who I was by teaching.

To elaborate, I'm someone without a great deal of self confidence.  So at thirteen when I had my first experience tutoring and someone said I'd be a good teacher, the decision was made.  I decided right then and there I would be a teacher.  This was sixteen years ago.  Because of that decision I constructed a plan, a life plan that I followed to the letter until I was about 24.  I went to a local community college and eventually university where I was accepted into the best teaching program in the state.

The way the teaching program worked is you'd be with the same group of people throughout most of your courses.  I was one of three guys.  This meant that anytime a 'male perspective' was needed I was more often than not called on.  This also planted a very strong seed of doubt in me.  Did I get into this program on my own merits, or because I was a guy?  I still don't know the answer to that question.  

Time went on and another problem arose.  I fell in love with writing.  This wasn't allowed, I was going to be a teacher.  I had to be a teacher, it's who I am.  Because without it, I'm nothing.  This attitude came from feverishly grasping the idea that teaching was the only thing I would ever be good at.  It also came from the fact that later courses seemed to be specifically molding the male teachers into, something.  This is hard to describe but I can boil it down to this feeling of ""don't be yourself"".  I even had a friend in a similar program who actually faced disciplinary action because when he was student teaching because he mentioned once that he had a fiance.  I can kind of understand why that happened but it still speaks to the notion that the school was actively teaching us not to be people.  Teachers are people too you know!

I eventually wised up and withdrew from the program.  I found myself working in early childhood education for three years.  I did love it, truly.  But I think the damage had been done.  I became an absolute workaholic, I was only happy at work.  It completely defined who I was.  I worked at that school for three years and the number of days I took off can be counted on one hand.  Whenever I wasn't working I found that I hated myself totally and completely.

And then COVID happened.  COVID forced to me quit my job and quarantine with my parents for 2020 and a good chunk of 2021.  In that time I started going to therapy, started working on myself.  I realized that teaching wasn't the only thing I was good at.  But because so much of my life had been defined by that.  We come to the all important question, who am I?  Well, I'm still figuring that out.  I'll end this with a quote from Dune that really resonated with me.

I know, I know, I know….. fame isn’t everything! It really doesn’t matter right? By the end of the day nobody’s lives are perfect or problem free, so who cares! 
I know logically all the reasonable answers to my emotions regarding fame . I know that it’s silly to think that fame solves everything; and here I am not talking about money, I don’t care that much really about money, though ofc everyone likes to feel rich let’s not lie, money DOES make a difference aside from fame, which you only get admiration. I also know, fame doesn’t buy you happiness and there are A LOT of disadvantages that I really don’t want to think about, I know all of that. 

Yet whenever I see people who have a large following, tons of followers and fans, and even regular people who get a lot of likes whether it’s on instagram, Facebook or Reddit, it makes me wish that was me and it starts making me envious. I sometimes think, how would my life be if I had so many people agreeing with me like that? And yes I know, I sound shallow when I put it that way, but i just get very jealous at times.

1650,CasualConversation,Job pays to chat on Facebook Messenger," Hello  job seekers   


Why would someone pay you to chat on Facebook Messenger?

Well, have you ever chatted to a business on their Facebook page? Or chatted to a business on any other social media platform?  


If you have, then the person you were chatting to on the other end is exactly the type of person who gets paid for chatting on social media.   


Businesses hire thousands and thousands of people to chat to their customers on their website and all social media platforms (including Facebook Messenger).   


Why?  


Because that is where their customers want to talk to them.  


\-They want to ask businesses in their Instagram DM’s about the features and price of a product  


\-They want to message the businesses Facebook page to ask a question about shipping

\-They want to use the live chat on the website before they purchase to ask any last minute questions

Customers expect businesses to offer chat as a sales and support option on their website and all social media channels.   


That means businesses have to hire a lot of people to do these live chat jobs.   


And that means you can get a nicely paid job, right now, working as a live chat assistant.   


Starting rates are 25 to 35 dollars / hr.   


Full training is provided, no experience necessary.

Fortunately, he took care of those bad feelings and made me understand that it’s only WORK and that it’s normal to appreciate a person’s beauty but it doesn’t take away his love for me. I opened up about my insecurities to him and that he needs to be patient with me because I am still adapting to his work environment. I completely understood everything he meant but what annoys me about myself is I still feel jealous from time to time no matter how hard I try not to. There are times when I completely shut off and I think he might already be getting impatient because this keeps happening to me and that I haven’t understood enough. It’s also important to take note that we are still at the early stage of our relationship. We’ve only been dating for 6months.

1662,CasualConversation,Breaking up with Bezos,"About 9 months ago, I decided to break up with Amazon after 20+ years. We'd been together since 1996 and I had quite the history with them, but the last straw was their accidental deletion of my account. I had both a personal and a semi-professional account and asked them to delete the latter... but whoever processed the request deleted both.

 I thought restoring it would be a simple matter, but Amazon's Kafkaesque system meant that I needed access to the deleted account to restore the account, so the account couldn't be worked on unless I had... well, you get the gist.

After fighting with them for a month, I just Elsa'ed and let it go. RIP my digital content.

But... this isn't about being bitter, it's about the impact it's had!

Positive? I've saved money, as lacking an easy, instant click way to order just about anything lends itself to buying things one doesn't really *need*. When I do need something, I often source it from smaller businesses and independent creators... or I go out and get it locally. And lastly, it removed what had been a low grade irritation for a while... I remembered Amazon when they were amazing so their evolution into the competition stifling behemoth that they are never sat well with me.

Negative impact? Surprisingly... not much. I have to exercise a bit of patience and I do spend more time trying to find what I need. Sometimes I have to skip over smaller vendors because they only sell through Amazon. And I mean... I do have to pass on that delightful Whole Foods buffet so there's that. ;-)

1682,CasualConversation,I like to think the butterfly effect conducts the laws of our universe and even our society.,"Hi, didn't know where to post this, but I've had this theory for a while that helped me and some friends go through a down phase. I've never explicitly made a well written text that is worthy of what I think about it, but this is what I told my friend when she felt useless and meaningless after getting out of a relationship. This explanation may be flawed and what not but yeah, feel free to ask details or add your opinions.

     
&gt;Have you ever heard of the butterfly effect ?

You see, everything in our universe relies on fundamental principles and affects every other thing. Like, take a flight somewhere and ask the pilot what does the plane account for ? He will tell you pressure, temperature, atmosphere, electromagnetic field, etc. 

The weather is another example except it has so many different parameters that it is impossible to be 100% accurate. Lorenz actually said that the tiniest parameter, like a butterfly's wing flap in brazil could cause a tornado in florida. Not because one automatically leads to the other but because if the butterfly flaps, it can impact the air around it and then create a change in the atmospheric pressure. The thing is, whether the butterfly flaps its wings or not, the tornado WILL happen. It is just a matter of when and this when can be influenced by the flap.

And i like to thing its the same thing with human society. Everything is meant to happen one day, but just because one person exists or even just lifts a finger at this moment, this location, our society evovles faster. 

And you can actually see it. Compare our actual society's evolution in the last decade compared to the whole last century. Let's say the most horrible person to ever exists exists. That is bad yes, but on the long term, it influences our society and evolution to happen faster (like new laws, new methods to stop these behaviours, etc). EVERY. ACTION. OF. ANYONE. IS. IMPORTANT. FOR. HUMANITY.

I still have my friends from uni in other German cities, but no one close enough to visit during the weekend regularly. I'm honestly starting to have doubts about the PhD I started and if I should just quit and move closer to home, even though this was literally my dream and I wouldn't find the type of jobs I want where my parents live. Suddenly it just hit me that I am 26 and alone, and none of my dates have been working out either. Oh, and I came back to find that my balcony is covered in pigeon shit and gotta clean that up too. Fun times. 


Just wanted to post here to listen to similar stories and because I don't want to confess that to my parents yet :(",sentient_spaceship,1641461350
1686,CasualConversation,I pranked a couple at a restaurant out of boredom.,"I never post here and forgive my loneliness but I just want to type or talk to someone. I want to tell a story and maybe I was slightly a jerk face or maybe not? It was all in good fun. 

To set the stage: A Friday night a few months back and this 44 year old male wanted to treat himself to a nice dinner in public. I went solo style because that’s just sometimes how I roll - single people like freshly prepared food just like anyone else. Eating alone can be empowering plus it’s always somewhat fun to people watch.

Walking up to the crowded hostess stand, I soon realized that this might not be an in-and-out type of situation. Bar seating was completely full. Couples lined up for days, all patiently awaiting their tables to the point I almost just straight up did an exit stage left after assessing the scene.  What the heck though? I just drove 20 mins to an uppity suburb in the metroplex and should’ve already known better when I got there based on the parking situation. I approach the hostess stand with little hope of getting any kind of seating within the hour. 

I was politely informed the wait would be 45 mins(not feeling that) BUT they did have one table available immediately. This was a table in their outdoor patio area in the farthest corner and unfortunately was not directly under any of the outside heaters on this chilly night. Ok sounds perfect for me.  When I eat alone I do just wanna have my meal in the quickest way possible, plus there’s not really anyone I’m gonna sit around and and make small talk with except for myself, and we really prefer to eat in silence these days  

I get seated in the corner and it’s damn cold. Jacket is staying on.  Scanning the patio I see patrons, families and couples all enjoying their libations and foods and generally having a good time with their Friday night excursions directly under the heat lamps. They all looked so nice a toasty while sharing their experiences for the week, while lonely solo boy sits in the corner shivering for 15 mins; like the forgotten one-top that is maybe barely worth serving since we aren’t known to be the biggest cash cows when it comes to service industry standards. Did I mention this is a somewhat snooty part of town? I tried to check my bitterness at the door but the chill in air was making me anxious even though I was warned by the hostess. This is fine though. Everything is fine. It’s time to distract myself with some people watching and maybe even catching various snippets of their convos. Look at their body language and imagine how their lives play out while they enjoy their meals/camaraderie at a comfortable temperature . Guessing if couples are on a first date; families with the cute kiddos having their weekend outing. The 2 ladies sitting at a table the closest to me seemed like they were old friends catching up. Would’ve loved to join them but really only because they had a heater directly above and the waitress checked on them 3 times, while I was having a mini existential crisis contemplating if I even existed in her eyes.  What a sad story right? I started playing on my phone since that’s what we all seem to do when escapism is needed. 

I did finally get the waitress’s attention just to ask who would be serving me. She did apologize and of course they were busy as hell and it was just one of those things that should be expected. No worries. I was the big boy that decided to sit in the sad, cold forgotten corner patio table. 

I place all my orders immediately: dranks, salad, main course cuz let’s get this show on the road before the poor lady has to hop around to 10 other tables. I’m not here to mingle with myself and have dessert. I’m just imagining I could be slightly warmer if my table was 1 yard to the left towards one of the main heaters, but again I would’ve been encroaching on the 2 lady friends catching up so not happening. This old dude with a mustache has been banished to the cold corner and he knew what he was getting into when he signed up.

Food arrives and my style when eating alone is I just immediately give the card to my server and tell her to run the tab. She need not worry about me anymore since I’ve seen her struggle juggling so many other tables with Karens and Chads and I’m sure nice people too, but she had her hands full. Got the to go box as well since I knew this feast couldn’t all be consumed in one sitting. 

Everything is delicious and I am satisfied. I leave the waitress 30% tip cuz I know solo diners should be more generous and wanted to show a bit of appreciation for her hustle. 

At this point I should describe the patio setting: mostly enclosed with vinyl covering overhead and on the side, with multiple heaters all in place but obviously corner boy was not in the enclosed area, so I am full on outside with open air hence the chilliness. There are some very tiny bushes to my right and also behind me, basically acting as some sort of barrier between the restaurant patio and the sidewalk. I started formulating an idea to amuse myself. 

The 2 catch up girls that had been sitting closest to me had already left at this point. I scan the patio for my potential victims and see what presumably is a couple prob in the early 30s. They were having a good time - who knows if they were just getting to know each other or were just having a nice night out with complete familiarity but they seemed approachable. I thought it might be funny to give them something to talk about. 

My meal is done and I’m packed up and paid so I walk up to them. 

“Excuse me I’m sorry to interrupt y’all but if my server comes around looking for me, can you tell her I’m just dipping out real quick to have a smoke and I’ll be right back?”

They aren’t too taken aback or anything and are like of course and I tell them I really appreciate it. I then proceed to turn around and immediately high tail it towards to the corner of the small bushes my table was next to. Jump over the bushes like I am in a some kind Olympic hurdling event and land on the sidewalk. Giggling all the way to my car at running at full speed, I never look back and just drive off. 

I filled my head with scenarios all night. Did they say something to the waitress when they saw her? Did they just talk about it amongst themselves a bit thinking this clown just ran on his tab but maybe if the waitress wasn’t acting distressed it wasn’t worth saying anything? Why would he even say anything to us in the first place if he did actually dine and dash?  

The world will never know - unless you were that couple dining at fancy Italian restaurant in snooty suburb in TX and are reading this now. Sorry y’all, I was just having a laugh to amuse myself. Thank you for reading.",BLT5000,1641459021
1687,CasualConversation,Tonight i fell in love with a stripper.,"i haven’t been in love in a long time. i made a lot of money today, so i figured i’d go help the girls who work at the local club pay some tuition. it’s always a win-win. i’ve never been to a club locally, but whenever i have money i just want to blow, giving it to strippers is always a nice thing to do. they work hard and where i live they don’t get enough patronage. 

anyway i actually payed 150$ for a VIP dance with this one girl who i saw was working really hard, she was nice and a long timer. it was close to when the club was about to close and out of nowhere i notice the most beautiful girl i’ve ever seen. exactly my type. athletic, beautiful gray eyes, small breasts with a large booty and wide hips. more than anything else, her smile was infectious. we got to talking, and i gave her 20$ for a lap dance so we could talk longer. while she was giving me the dance she started asking me questions and doing a really flirty giggle when i would compliment her or touch her on her sides (she was small so really my hand could about fit around her waist). she put my hands on her legs when the manager wasn’t looking and all around just flirted with me, asking me all types of things. if you’re wondering how i know it was flirting and not just doing her job, it’s probably because i have her number and she and i are going to see the new spider-man movie and get dinner sunday. i haven’t been this happy about a date in a while. 

she’s got this look about her when she smiles…. i’ve only felt this once before and we fell in love and dated for half a decade.

i truly feel amazing. i had this woman who gets constantly complimented absolutely blushing when i told her about her eyes and her infectious smile. i’m so happy.",elilovesprivacy,1641458674

I had always envisioned and dreamed of losing my first kiss in some cutesy scenario with a soft song playing in the background. Again that changed!

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now and he’s the culprit in this case. The sly dog took me off guard and kissed me on his couch. But wait that’s not what I’m mad about. HE KISSED ME TO EMINEM “Lose Yourself”. But wait, there’s more! It was a remix of Lose Yourself where every other word was replaced with mom’s spaghetti! 

So now whenever I think back to my first kiss I think “knees weak, arms spaghetti. He’s nervous, moms spaghetti”

1693,CasualConversation,The CurveBall of Life,"For a while now I've been talking to this girl that works near my workplace and have only recently asked her out. We were planning to go out for food this Friday and things were going as planned until today. 

My manager, today, had symptoms of COVID so they had left early to get rapid testing, and unfortunately, the result came back positive. So you can probably guess next what happen based on the previous paragraph.

I had to let the girl know that we had to cancel the plans we had. 

Now I know it seems selfish that I'm complaining about a canceled date when someone I work with tested positive with COVID, but that is not my intention at all, I wouldn't wish ill upon anyone. 

If anything, I'm just feeling down about it all. 

My luck with girls is not the greatest and this is the first time that someone is openly interested in making plans with me. So it sucks that this curveball was thrown at me.

I will likely try to reschedule a new date with her a couple of days out, but honestly, it's really got my mood down. I was really looking forward to it. I know I'm probably being overdramatic and it's not like I blew my shot.

Things really just don't always go as planned, anyone would like to share their own personal story of the curveballs of life? Not a competition of who has it worst of course.",dara_san2,1641455889

The reddit downvote button is good against trolls, but when I ask a question, I get downvoted so easily and i don't know why. Maybe because my posts questions are bad?

1704,CasualConversation,02/02/22 Day of The Fallen,"Tl;dr at the bottom

The year was 2018. It was a quiet day at college. I walk into math class stoney baloney per the usual. I had prepared a burrito ahead of time to eat in the back of class. We had just taken a test which meant today was the start of a new lesson. Today was a perfect day to slack off. I never payed attention in class anyways. I usually picked up the lesson at home when I would study for tests the night before. I would pass every quiz baked. The professor knew. He would call me out walking into class sometimes, ""Anon, why are your eyes bloodshot?"". Anyways, I'm sitting in the back of class unpacking my lunch. I set my drink then my burrito on the table. As I begin to unwrap the foil covering my burrito, my grip slips. The burrito begins to fall to the floor. My face mortified. Time slows down and the room is silent. The burrito unravels once it hits the floor. It's contents spead on the carpet. I stood up and fell to my knees. ""NOOOOO! MY BURRITOOOOOO!"" It's been 4 years since that day. Every year on February 2nd, I eat a burrito to morn the burrito I dropped in math class. It serves as a reminder to appreciate your food. You never know what may happen. My gf doesn't think this is credible enough to count as a holiday though. So help me out redditors. Morn with me. Can we make February 2nd, Day of The Fallen?

I feel like I have no one in my life. Sure there are people that care about me on a surface level but I mean nothing to people all things considered. I feel like I have no one to back me up and that no one cares. I’ve also stopped seeing any meaning to keep going.

I see no point to continue living, all outcomes lead to the same reality I’m living right now.

1714,CasualConversation,Why am I sometimes cold/defensive?,"I’m unsure if this is the right place to ask this but I’m having a hard time understanding something about myself and I’m hoping someone can guide me in the right direction to help me better understand myself. I apologise if this is the wrong sub and would appreciate if I could be directed to a more suitable sub. 

Recently I’ve realised whenever I get too close to someone or whenever I think someone is about to break my trust, I instantly distance myself without hesitation and become very cold. The most recent instance was with two people, I understand why I became distant and this situation helped me to understand that the reason I become distant is as a defence mechanism to protect myself from getting hurt or from getting more hurt. In general I’m not a cold person, I’m entirely the opposite. It’s only as soon as I think someone is disingenuous and untrustworthy.  

One thing I’m struggling to understand is where did this come from? Sometimes I want to go to someone and tell them how I feel, but the second I see them I physically cannot talk, smile or even make eye contact with them. Even if I am in a room with many people, if that one person is there I would be shut out from the entire room emotionally. This isn’t by choice, I’ve tried to physically control it but I’ve never succeeded. So what I’m trying to understand is for people who are also like this, what is typically the common reason as to where this defence mechanism comes from. Why do we get so defensive and cold? Why can’t I just act normally in front of them. For example; if my mum has been hurt by someone or if she can’t trust them, she can put a fake smile on for the sake of peace. Whereas if I’ve been hurt by someone or if I don’t trust them, I will show it by acting very cold. 

If any one of you are the same way or know someone that is the same way and you know where this stems from and what is the root cause then please let me know. I’m hoping to try and understand myself through reading other peoples experiences. Thank you for your time.",tody697,1641447457

1720,CasualConversation,"Looking Back To My Best Memories, Music Just Makes Every Experience 10 Times Better!","Think of when you’re driving through a road that is completely empty and you’ve kept the window open just enough to let the cool and fresh air of the rainy weather in. The road goes through the jungle and both sides of road are covered by tall trees, still wet from the aftermath of rain. You have no one in car with you and you start playing your favourite music. It can be anything ranging from Beatles to Madonna, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, Taylor Swift, Florida Georgia line, Hans Zimmer, Joe Hisaishi, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven- anything you name it. You enjoy the hell out of this journey and return to your destination. Years pass by, you have now gotten older, weaker and somewhat out of time as they say it. You somehow got a chance to go through the same road, in the same weather and to add to our little fantasy, let’s say on the same time and same car as well. You remember you listened to that one music track as you were going through these roads and you again put them on and as the first verse of “All too well” hits, you start tearing up a little bit and you think of life, your struggles through it, your first school, your first job, your first love of life, your best friends, your marriage, your children, your best memories with them and so on. You think of these experience as something larger than life, you say, “O Life, You were Beautiful, charming and worth living!” You thank yourself for making this journey in past so that you could experience this again in the last few chapters of your life. 

Above piece was just something that i made up. I just wanted to share my experiences that are almost similar to this one. Whenever i go through various phases of my life, at various periods, in various ways, at different places, i always start listening to music that resonates with me, and somehow it just connects like a bond stronger than ever. Whenever i go thorugh that same situation once again later in my life, it reminds me that, “It was this song or piece of music or album that i listened back then!” And i listen to that again and sudden and unexplained courage just fills me up with unknown energy.

1722,CasualConversation,"It's a bit old to talk about, but I'm disappointed with Cowboy Bebop LA","Not the LA itself, but the massive amount of hate it generated. I really don't feel like that extreme was necessary. I've watched quite a few live actions. One or two matching the anime beat for beat, most being made because ""oo look! Money grab!"".

This one wasn't either of those. Because of that, it was a little off putting with some of the side characters, but the main characters (aside from Ed's choppy appearance) were pretty great I felt like. The story was changed from a series of shorts to an actual plotline - which made sense because you could clearly tell they had a plan.

It wasn't as if this was some anime that recently came out and people were reaching for compensation, this was genuinely fan made and you can totally see that. I said it before, but I feel like people rewatched the anime and expected a beat for beat thing. It wasn't that... And in the grand scheme of Live Action, if it isn't that, it's usually bad. Generally I agree... But this... Had more heart than people gave it credit for. It didn't deserve this heat.

That's it. I don't know how many of you saw it, or watched the anime ages back, but I just wanted to say my piece somewhere.",Rotating_Coffin,1641443438

Which is why I’ve never really wanted to climb the corporate ladder. I’ve chosen to do work that earns enough for my lifestyle.

My work now isn’t prestigious nor will I ever earn a 6-figure. But it gives me enough time to pursue my hobbies and other stuff. The workload is light, the responsibilities is manageable, and I go to work feeling comfy with my routine and its stability.

Last night she messaged me on fabebook ""Girl, for your own sake, run.  He's abusive and will ruin your life"" and then when I replied looking for more information, she blocked me.

I right away rang my boyfriend and asked him about the message and he told me to ignore it. He makes me feel so very safe and not once have I ever felt uneasy, or noticed any red flags around him. So I 99.5% believe him. 

But there's that 0.5% now that has doubts. Not due to anything he has done, he is amazing but I can't imagine someone would just accuse someone of abuse that easily? He works with vulnerable people so if he really was abusive, surely she would have reported him and he would be out of a job? I don't know.

Have many interests - love learning about people and different cultures/lifestyles than my own as well as bonding over shared culture and interests. 
I’m into pretty much all kinds of music, I also dabble with DJing a little bit. I have a super cute dog who is my best pal.  Into photography/videography. Sports wise I am mainly into UFC/MMA/Boxing/Horse racing/Darts but also follow a bit of motorsport and footy as well as NBA/NFL. 
Play a bit of PlayStation now and then, mainly cod. Love going out at exploring. 
If you share some those hobbies let me know and if you don’t, introduce me to your interests! 
Into lots of things and very open minded.

It's McDonald's so it's nothing special but it pays well, at least for UK standards for my age I believe. I hear people complaining about it on the job but if they think this is hard work then they don't know what life is yet.

This may be my first ever job, but it's certainly not the first time I've ever worked. I've done manual labour and helped family earn money, and some of those were tough. As hard as that was, my family has gone through much tougher times when they were younger. So for my colleagues to complain about their job is, in my opinion, very silly. My walk home was more demanding than the last 10 hour shift I did!

Anyways, I'm an immigrant in the UK although I've been living here for about a third of my life.

We're having a few drinks after golf and talking about meeting celebrities (we'd just met a minor one on the golf course) and he pipes up about having cooked for a couple. We ask who's the most famous?

He says a few years back he's asked if he can go and cook close to Christmas for Phil Collins, something about the usual chef being unable to do it. So he turns up before his other staff to start preparing and Phil comes and sees him and says he knows he's setting up but the guests will be arriving soon and would he be good enough to look after them as they do. My friend agrees.

A little time later he's walking out to his car to bring some more things through and there's an old guy waiting in the hall on a sofa. He asks this old fella if he needs anything and he says 'yes please, would you mind lighting the hall fire?' which he proceeds to do 

He's back in the kitchen and Phil comes in and asks if everything is ok and my friend responds words to the effect of 'yes fine, by the way there was an old fella in your hall who said he was a bit cold so I lit him a fire' to which Collins responds........'oh, so you met Mr Clapton'

I want somebody who is the opposite. Preferably somebody who is wild. As much as I hate to admit it, too many Asian men are socially awkward and spend most of their free time playing video games.

1775,CasualConversation,Two Work Compliments and One Anonymous Helpful Neighbor,"I had three things happen today that made my day!
I am a kindergarten teacher (this is my 4th year), and I have a foster grandma who helps out three mornings a week. We don't get a whole lot of time to chat, but as she was leaving today she stopped me to tell me what a great job I do. She pointed out how I am very patient and keep calm even when she can tell I am sometimes frustrated. I thanked her for the compliment, and for her help in the classroom as well. 
Soon after, as I brought my students to the lunch line I reminded a student that he needed to apologize to one of the lunch paras for a sad choice he made at lunch the day before. He asked me to go with him. We went up to the para and he apologized. When he went back to the lunch line, the para commented on how I do such a good job of following up with situations (having the student apologize for yesterday's behavior). I thanked her for the compliment.
The last thing happened when I got home from work. As a little backstory, I bought a house about 3 months ago, and have since had to use my snowblower a few times this winter. When I left for work this morning there was about 3 inches of snow in my driveway, and it continued to snow more throughout the work day. As I was driving home, I was thinking about having to snowplow my driveway and sidewalks. I wasn't really dreading it, but I wasn't particularly looking forward to it. When I got home I was shocked to see that my driveway, my sidewalks, and even the paths inside my yard had been snowblowed and/or shoveled. I think I know which neighbor did it. I saw my neighbor using his snowblower on part of my sidewalks a couple weeks ago, and I'm guessing it was the same one. I haven't spoken much with these neighbors yet since it is winter, and I'm inside most of the time that I'm home. But I am so grateful to whomever did this kind act.

My family is breaking up from the inside out, and I can't shake the feeling I was the cause of it, even though I knew it was a long time coming. 
I lost a loved one 2 years ago, who I still miss just as much as the day they left us. 
I was rejected from my University in 2020 because my grades weren't good enough. 
I was having daily breakdowns, bad thoughts, trouble sleeping and generally very unwell since 2019. 

Recently, I got into a new relationship with someone who is undoubtedly better, who is the most supportive, loving person and genuinely amazing to be around. 
I got out of the toxic house that was making me ill ad draining my mental health, almost to the point of no return. 
I got onto my dream course at University 5 hours away from everyone I knew so I could start fresh, and since September have been focusing on doing the best I can in my studies. 
I have an amazing job, an amazing set of friends and an amazing partner.

1791,CasualConversation,Is it bad that I don't hate having COVID?,"Well, I can't be 100% sure, as there are no COVID tests available within a 30 mile radius of me right now. However, two of my coworkers have tested positive for COVID, and I have been home about 4 days now feeling like absolute crap. Two other coworkers of mine apparently called out today with the same symptoms. My cousin and her daughter are both sick, my boyfriend and his dad are both sick, I have three close friends who are sick, and now my dad is starting to get sick... 

We are having a massive spike in cases here where I live after New Years, everyone was going out partying unprotected apparently. So massive that we have no tests available at all. I feel like I've been run over by a truck and this might just be the worst sore throat I've ever had in my life. I feel really crappy, but at the same time... I'm almost relieved? I sort of feel... good?

I have been so mentally and physically burnt out from work lately. My coworker was granted four weeks of vacation time that included Christmas AND New Years, and my supervisor AND GM both decided to take vacations right around that time too. I also just started college classes again, which has been taking up much of the little bit of free time I've had. I haven't been able to see any friends, family, or my boyfriend AT ALL. I was so fed up that I was contemplating actually quitting my job. 

I really don't like being sick, and I really hate that my loved ones are getting sick too... but these past few days that I've been at home, pretty much doing nothing except resting and a minimal amount of school/house work... it's been bliss. I didn't know how worn down I really was until I actually just got a few good days of rest and took a mental break from my job. I feel actually sane right now. It's a damn shame I've had to get this sick for me to be able to take a break. I'm gonna milk every second of quarantine that I can. I feel like I should hate this, but compared to the alternative I had before, I'm actually enjoying myself. It makes me feel kinda bad.

I pray for my friends and family, and for any of you or your family out there, that we can all pull through this sudden surge of COVID cases as safely as we can.",p0ltergeists,1641414241

1796,CasualConversation,Almost got in a deadly car accident...and now I feel a lot better about life?,"So today I decided to go get a coffee at Starbucks--free reward, heck ya! Usually the biggest risk is the god forsaken parking lot of the plaza the Starbucks is in. Made it out fine, and I'm sitting at the light waiting to turn left. Sidenote, I'm the first car at the light as well. The light's still red so I took the moment to check the label of my cup to make sure my order is right--gotta make sure it's dairy free so my throat doesn't close up haha. I'm about to sip my drink and I see that the light suddenly turned green. Within the split second of me placing my drink in my cup holder and slowly inching forward (the stop line in the left turning lane I was in is significantly further back from the crosswalk/intersection than the forward/right turn lane line if that makes sense) to go, a car zooms across the intersection, inches away from me, running the red light. It happened so fast I almost couldn't process it. There was one car in the oncoming lane across from me also waiting to turn left, I remember making eye contact with the man as we turned and we both looked stunned. If either of us had gone and turned just a second earlier--bam. Donezo.

I had the urge to check my drink label as I was leaving the drive thru, as if the drink is wrong I can just turn right back. But I just knew to wait until I got to the light--am I ever grateful for listening to my intuition! Had I not been distracted by my coffee and simply gone the second the light went green I would've been t-boned into the next millennium...I also forgot to mention its raining today! And it's Canada so there's still snow slush and ice out! Could've been extremely bad! 

I catatonically drove home in shock at what happened. It felt so surreal. The first thought that came to me after making the turn was ""my guardian angels really f\*\*\*ing got me!"". I was literally seconds from what could have been a fatal collision. 

I'm not saying that this almost NDE is what made me appreciate my life--it just helped me to gain a new perspective, especially when needed most. How short life is. How we're not always given second chances, and how living in the present moment is the best you can do for yourself. There's no use dwelling on the past and losing yourself over things you don't know or cant control. Lately I've been dealing with a break up, uncertainty regarding my job, seasonal depression, living back with my parents for who knows how long and now these new lockdown restrictions (smd Dougie you look like a honey ham.)...and this experience this morning made me realize how small all those problems are. Your life can literally be taken in the blink of an eye-! If you are suffering in the moment, it will pass and one day you'll look back at yourself and the pain you went through and smile because you got through it! Appreciate life and take each day as it comes to you! 

As awful as it sounds to say, I guess this was sort of a blessing in disguise. This abrupt incident gave me the clarity I needed most at a time I was least expecting it--the universe works in crazy ways lmao.

The 6th grade one takes place in the Himalayas and I think that the 4th grade one is in a forest.  It was a pretty fun game, with challenging puzzles and an interesting plot.  I'd actually like to try and do them again as I am in my 30's and want to see if the same parts challenge me as much.  I am much older and my nephew and niece are under 5, so I don't know what educational games are like nowadays, but I feel like the ones that I've seen aren't as engaging as the one that I played.  They seem to be more phone app like, with puzzles just thrown at you, rather than the engaging storyline that I remember.  It's been a while, and I have a terrible memory, so I could definitely be wrong.

I also had Mario Teaches Typing and I loved that game so much.

1809,CasualConversation,"My SO is awesome, and Reddit needs more wholesome relationship posts!","Please reply with something you appreciate or like about someone close to you in your life! 

My SO and I have been together for a long time, since we were teenagers. We've had our ups and downs, but have always tried our best to grow and work on our issues. Even when our relationship was at its rockiest, he never spoke to me the way my father would to my mother, we always tried to be nice to each other and take accountability for our foul-ups. It certainly helps that we've been crazy about each other since the night we met. 

The event that sparked this post happened yesterday. I am not working at the moment for reasons I won't get into right now, so I have been doing the brunt of housework and cleaning. This has worked well, he appreciates it and doesn't treat me like a maid or complain about what I do with my time. (He's a redditor and gets infuriated by the posts where husbands don't consider domestic labor as 'labor') 

Yesterday I deep cleaned our bedroom and reorganized everything before suddenly getting a headache and laying down on the couch. I simply mentioned that I wasn't feeling up to making dinner, and asked if he could handle it. I would have been happy with literally anything, as he works from home all day. We have boxed mac and cheese and frozen pizza on deck for situations like this. 

Instead he made the most delicious roast potatoes and brussel sprouts, smoked some chicken thighs using the dry rub I had already prepared earlier this week, and baked me a garlic and herb bread loaf in our new Dutch Oven. It was delicious, and now I feel like I have to up my game! He loved the compliments and told me about what he researched to make the potatoes so crispy, it was adorable and honestly helped my headache more than the painkillers. I really appreaciate that my SO treats our relationship like a team effort, and that makes it pretty easy to work through normal relationship ups and downs.

Maybe I should watch it but I feel like I’ve watched all the funny parts now but yea all out of context and the storyline seems like a lot maybe I will eventually though

I did do this with Brooklyn nine nine then I ended up watching it and then watching again and again

With the last man on earth tho I saw one clip of it and immediately turned on Hulu and binged it and I have been rewatching it ever since

1839,CasualConversation,We have not had power for 53 hours so far. It was 18F (-8C) last night and 25F (-4)C the night before.,"This is in Northern Virginia. 40 miles south of Washington DC

Good news:
This is the first time I have cell/data service in 2 days.

Mostly Bad news:
It was 61F (16C) and rainy for 2 days. Then in a matter of hours it went below freezing and we got 8in of snow (20cm). Trees were filled with water from the rain and turned to ice on the inside causing them to break.

Trees started falling down left and right and there are now fallen power lines all over the place.

This happened from 4am-10am Monday Morning. It is currently Wednesday morning.

For a while The roads were too icy and steep to leave our neighborhood (fallen trees also contributed to this). 

Power company just got to the beginning of our neighborhood last night. 

Our generator ran out of gas but we have propane to barbecue and enough fire wood to last us at least 24 more hours (if we use it sparingly). 

On Monday 77% of our county didn’t have power. Today 50% doesn’t.

Very bad news:

There’s  another storm coming on Thursday night.

Good news:
Body heat underneath a blanket keeps you alive but it’s still cold enough to keep this massive headache I have from going away. 

Our neighborhood came together and we used chainsaws to remove the parts of trees that were in the middle of the road. Now the power company can get through and they’re giving us an estimate of power coming back on between 6pm-11pm tonight! Things suck so idk if they can make their estimate.",blue-trout,1641396952

1841,CasualConversation,Just got a call that I'm no longer a part of a college program,"Two years ago I enrolled in an early college program so I was taking high school and college classes. This was my last year and it was all college classes. It went well the first year, and then Covid happened. I quickly learned how incompatible with online learning and my grades dropped fast.

They didn't drop me from the program at first since I was far from the only person in that situation. But I guess three semesters straight of flunking nearly every class was too much.

I should be upset about this, but I'm not that upset honestly. I've wanted out since last year. I just can't do online classes. I was not looking forward to the upcoming semester. I am a little upset I won't get the certificate of completion, but I guess I haven't really earned it. 

Normally this program would net me 60 college credits. I only learned 20ish which is a far cry from 60, but it's still a lot better than zero I guess.

Only thing is, I'm now in the job market for the first time ever and I am very nervous about that. Any advice for that is thoroughly appreciated!

I don't know. I guess I just feel a little uncertain. This was sort of the last thing I had going on in my life. I can't realistically go to college with Covid still around, so now I'm just waiting for it to go away. That's going to be my life for, well, awhile.",wt_anonymous,1641395487
1842,CasualConversation,I quit vaping with little withdrawals.,"For context, I thought I was a lost cause. I used 50mg vape juice (which in comparison to cigarettes that averages to 8mg per puff). I could vape for hours at a time, without breaks. And to top it off, withdrawal symptoms set in after one hour, meaning it was hard to focus on any tasks. And this was for 5 years. 

My friend, who’s always been vehemently against my addiction, gifted me a copy of EasyWay to quit nicotine. I was intrigued after reading the first few chapters, so I actually bought it on audiobook to listen to while working. 

Which leads me to this post. I went from 50mg to 0 over night. And overall, it was roughly a 1 out of 10 on the difficulty scale. Yeah, the first day I was mentally going back and forth on quitting, but after the 24 hours mark, it was easy peasy. No withdrawal pangs I was used to, no uneasiness, burst of anger, or any other mental issues. 

My biggest complaint from the whole experience, which is not even the books fault, was the lack of sleep I was getting. Not that I was anxious, but it was just hard to sleep. But you know, going from 50 mg of chain vaping to zero, I wasn’t too surprised. So while I’m over nicotine, I still might order some nicotine patches to help with sleep, to give my body some time to really adjust to no nicotine. 

For those wondering how can a book make this wonderful thing happen, all I have to say is give it a shot. Again, I thought I was a lost cause, but this book really opened my eyes that giving up nicotine is just that easy. Now I’m wondering what other addictions I can tackle next, knowing that giving up nicotine (which is one of the “hardest” things to give up) was just that easy.",ProjectGnova,1641395149

 I was quite Happy with my 120kg last yeahr, but now I seriously need to work on it. The Problem is, I really like eating, and I also eat most things I get to, which is likely the main reason I am this tall, since I dont have a height-related medical condition and its also not genetically, my family is rather normal. 

I like to do sports together, but I rather dislike doing it alone, and I really dont like to go to the gym, which leads to only having American football Training twice a week (dont live in the US). 

Up to arround beeing 12, it was rather Uncommon for me to stop eating before all was empty, and I didnt really feel full untill I wasnt able to eat anymore without trowhing up, and this point was only reached when 
A there was a big feast, like for Christmas, 
B when we visited Grandma/ Great Grandma
C We went to a Brazilian Rodicio, which not only incorporated a 21 Courses but also a Starter and a dessert buffet.

So Im quite happy to be able to stop eating before I finished my Plate, but also beeing the First to finish, since Im normally the one who finishes Last or second last while also eating the fastest.

1849,CasualConversation,Day 3 of no power in freezing temps,"A winter storm in our area knocked out our power. Trees broke under the wet of all the wet, heavy snow and took down 2 power lines on our property. My husband checked the outage map and there are ~300 outages affecting god knows how many people in the area our power coop services. A man from the company came out to assess the damage. He said that’s not his actual job, but the crews are stretched thin because our state is not equipped for this weather and people are out with Covid. Crews from surrounding states are coming in to help repair downed lines. I’m so grateful for the work they do.

We are fortunate enough to have a generator, plenty of blankets, and some bottled water. The generator isn’t working at full capacity so the heat and well don’t work, but we’re staying bundled up and running a couple space heaters in our bedroom. We’re about to take a trip to the nearest gas station to stock up on fuel again and use the bathroom. My husband requested emergency leave from work. More snow is expected Friday.

1850,CasualConversation,Do you ever think about the causes of events in your life and think about all the small things that happened to lead to them?,"For example if you first met your significant other at a bar one day and you only went in there because you were thirsty and the only reason you were thirsty was because a stranger threw a bag of peanuts at you that morning and you ate them. I'd always think if it wasn't for that crazy peanut man I wouldn't have met a very important person in my life. Then think well if the peanut man didn't steal those peanuts he woulnd't have had them to throw and the only reason he stole them was because the shop owner was taking a shit at the time and left the store unguarded. And the only reason the store owner had diarrhea was because the Chipotle he had was undercooked and the reason the Chipotle was undercooked was because the kid making it was having a rough day, etc. etc. 

Of course in reality you wouldn't know a lot of this, but I still think about things in this way. Is this some kind of disorder? Is there are particular type of person who thinks this way?

The   friends I have was from when I was still in high school and honestly, I feel like we have drifted away from each other already. Don’t get me wrong though I like being alone but I also like the company of others. I guess I’m not really close to anyone I know because somehow, I always feel like I’m oversharing so I tend to not talk much. I’m more of a listener but I’d also like to share my part. My social skills suck and   I’m not an initiator. I kind of have a hunch that I will die  alone when I think of living. It has always been me and my journal.

I've always loved travelling and have always wanted to do a big backpacking trip seeing lots of different countries and meeting people along the way. 

I aimed to leave by Sept 2020, and obviously this didn't end up working out! I've been desperate to go and keep pushing back the dates as I want to wait until its more feasible to travel to multiple places without having to constantly isolate etc. I know it's a real first world issue and plenty of people are in far worse situations, and for most of the pandemic I've really tried to be positive about my dream trip being delayed because of that, but I feel like with the latest Omicron stuff it's just become a bit much. 

I've done some small trips in my country (UK) when restrictions etc. have allowed, and have obviously done various other things, but I feel like I've got to the point where I'm just sat waiting every day to finally go, and I don't think I can cope with that for another year or something haha.

Usually about the fundamentals of existence and individual experience. I’ve also always found math to make much more sense than anything else I was ever taught. So, I usually apply some formula or mathematical framework to support or test the theories I am daydreaming about. 

Many times in my life I’ve had close friends or family members ask me what I was thinking about while I was daydreaming. I never thought much of it and I will sometimes ask other people what they are thinking about if I think they are deep in thought. 

But my wife has asked me this on many occasions, and then after I respond she will comment “I knew it was math”. Or she will notice I am not asleep and ask my if I am thinking about math. And I made the assumption that she was making guesses because I think about it often and she knows that. 

But the other day my wife walked into the room asking me a question. I didn’t totally register what she said and asked if she could repeat her question. She made a comment along the lines “Yes, sorry I didn’t notice you were making your math face” I laughed because I was thinking about something math related.

I then mentioned this to a life long friend. He casually responds with, “oh yeah, I know you’re math face. “


And I’ve been thinking about it since then and have been able to identify the facial expression I make. And I’ve been tripping out on the fact that I have a facial expression that I was unaware of but other people know what it means. And it means I’m thinking mathematically.",N00N12,1641375061

I just got into a car accident last week. It's another one of those many moments in life where I pause and look outwards to the universe and say ""I don't need another lesson. I don't need more lemons to squeeze and make lemonade."" You know?

Sometimes shit just happens and you just have to deal with it. Sometimes there's absolutely no reason for it, and why should there be? We keep trying to look out to the universe to 'justify' our damages. Because otherwise, all of the damage you've got is not ***good*** damage. It's just damage. (Bojack Horseman does such a good episode on this)

I've grown to dislike this idea. It always felt empty to me. Like a lie I kept telling myself to keep living.

I've realized that I don't have to keep trying to make every little shitty thing have meaning. Sometimes a shitty thing is just that: a shitty thing. And I don't have to look to the universe for meaning. I can create my own little pockets of meaning in this infinite universe. And maybe that's enough.",rationalspirituality,1641372044

I think in 2020 the novelty of the pandemic and everything that entailed and changed was a little interesting, but that was long gone in 2021. The biggest things that helped me keep my good days up (despite the drop in great days) was making peace with things I could no longer do and trying new things.

I've found I like riding a bike for fun, taking photos, learning how to ride a longboard (which was a bit scary at the start), taking a drive to a remote beach for the day, recording short videos of nature, getting my fitness back, losing my fitness over Christmas/NY, stretching (omg seriously make an effort to do 15mins a day) and so on. I'm hoping 2022 will be a better year than last, but if not oh well, this shit show wont 't last forever.

Also sorry for the differing layouts for each year, I think I've settled on a template that I'll stick with now.

1885,CasualConversation,How to stay between not getting attached and attached?,"""go with the flow ... solve your codependency issue ..etc"" you hear ""life coaches"" talk about being free from attachments but how can be done without affecting my efforts?

When I'm not attached to someone, I don't put much effort to maintain a friendship or continue getting to know them. Like I won't call/text and don't care if they call or not, because they don't have much impact on my life like someone I talk to every day and then we go two days without talking and feel something is missing. 

Couple of months ago I started talking to a girl on twitter dms (in my city) every other day where I initiated most of the conversations, getting to know them was interesting but as soon as I learned a deal breaker I stopped initiating conversation, the idea of meeting her is gone and I just reply.  This also showed who was putting effort to get to know the other since she stopped talking (even though she was engaging well in the conversations). Maybe she saw me as just twitter friend while I had hoped to be something else irl. Here I'm free from attachment because I no longer care if we stay in touch.

Now I started talking to a new girl and repeating the cycle where she gets my full attention to get to know her since we are clicking well and so far no deal breakers. To me, if I don't text her every day or other day even for just 10 min of chatting during ""getting to know the"" stage it means I'm not interested, because I don't want her to think I'm just a twitter chatting buddy.",zeldrisgw,1641370889

1899,CasualConversation,Content creators who have completely fallen off in recent years?," 

What are examples of Youtubers/content creators who have completely fallen off in recent creators?

An example I can think of is George Weidman/Super Bunnyhop. Super Bunnyhop. He does a lot of gaming journalism and longform analysis videos, at least back in the day. But now his content has slowed to a crawl. He has only uploaded 7 videos for 2021 and they are of lesser quality compared to his work from the past 5-7 years. He has not updated his Patreon since late 2019-early 2020, his upload frequency is a lot less consistent, he has clearly lost a lot of his passion and drive for the subject matter he used to love, in fact, he seems to have a lot of contempt with the gaming industry (and modern society as a whole).

The views for his recent videos are very low compared to his subscriber account. He only hits just over 10% of subs in views per video when 2-3 years ago he's been hitting 4-5 times that much views, so sub to views ratio was insane back then. I used to enjoy his old videos, but he's become less interesting and it looks like his videos aren't doing too well.",cybershocker455,1641362624

 I hate the idea of them spending money on something I don’t like/need/want, when they could give me something that’s on my list of things I need. Ever since my parents noticed I disliked surprises and presents, they started asking me for what I wanted for my birthday or Christmas, and I do the same for them, so I don’t understand why gifts have to be a big thing with other people. 
All this rant started because my boyfriend told me he just bought my Christmas present. We are currently in different cities, so he’s giving it to me when we see each other and I sent his to his house directly (which I struggled so much to find because he wouldn’t tell me what he wanted, so I literally sent him a book and something else, I also felt the obligation to give him something, I didn’t do it from the heart). I have so much rage inside me because I know I’m just going to hate whatever he gives me just because I don’t like gifts. Also, everything I want I save for and buy it myself, always. I don’t want to tell him this just because I don’t want to seem weird, or I don’t want him to not give me anything ever again, I just want to be on control of what he gives me even if it costs him $0, that’s not what I care about. I currently can’t even speak to him because I’m mad and I know I can’t tell him anything, he literally did nothing wrong, he just bought me a present with all his love but I just don’t want it.

It's strange, but i feel like it's users have this weird ""condescending "" style of writing where they come off as a ""adult trying to teach a dumb kid a life lesson"" instead of actually answering your questions and debating you drectly. They can also come off as prententious and not really interested in giving out their own opinion but beliting your own positions as foolish or nonsensical.

1941,CasualConversation,Date rejection,"So I met a girl on a dating app. We had a date yesterday and I thought it was great. It was a lockdown date. So we  cooked some spaghetti, played jenga and watched a movie together. I thought she was funny as hell and and really sweet. We ended up kissing allot at the end of the movie and afterwards I walked her to the train station. This evening she sent a message that she doesn't feel a connection and that she normally never kisses on the first date. I feel like I messed up by going in for the kiss. But she didn't want to stop kissing either. On that evening she actually waited to take the last train and left as late as possible. She really seemed into me and enjoying herself. Somehow I feel like she is just freaked out because I might have come across as liking her to much. Eitherway I feel sad as hell. I know its dumb because she is someone I only met once. But I don't often meet girls like her either.  And it kind of hurts hearing her say she felt no connection after all that. It just makes me feel like girls only see my faults, my weaknesses, my anxiety and not my strengths and who I am. Am I really that oblivious to feel a connection that she doesn't? I know no one here can answer if I'm oblivious. You don't know me. But I just need to get it out there. I feel so lonely and shity. 
As far as I can remember I have felt lonely. My oldest memories are of being alone as a kid at the age of 4. All I have wanted sinds I was 14 was someone in my life. I'm 23 now. I just can't seem to find someone I feel good with who also feels good with me.
Besides this my whole day has been about procrastinating homework and feeling anxious as I have done every day of my life. And it's topped of by her dissapointing text message. 
Somehow it is actually nice to feel this sadness washing over me. Music finally sounds good again. And somehow these tears warm me and take me out of the daily dread that I have been feeling the last few weeks",666gardengnome,1641347330

1955,CasualConversation,Do you think using truth serums is ethical? What is your argument?,"Truth serums (using sedatives like diazepam, scopolamine, sodium pentothal etc) to make people more compliant and easier to influence (easier to manipulate into talking). 

It because hard to conjure up a good lie or to keep track of the lies you've told and be consistent with them when you're tired and unfocused (sedated). So, even if it doesn't get them to tell the truth, it could make it more obvious when they're lying. 

Also, sedatives like that make one not wanting to be bothered by the extra cognitive activity that lying requires. Telling the truth becomes easier than lying. As well as it also makes them less lucid/more suggestive. It would be easier to manipulate them into believing telling the truth is in their best interest.

So they work, but do you think they're ethical?",ToesyToeNails,1641343436

1962,CasualConversation,Explain this!! Feet have slightly shrunk??,"Hey everyone! I’ve always been curious about the biology/mechanism on how certain things occur, so I wanted your guys help in conjuring up some possible explanations and hearing personal anecdotes of anything similar!

Context: I normally wear size 6 (womens) shoes but depending on the brand, I can squeeze into a 5.5. I have a favorite pair of shoes that are size 5.5 which I purchased in 2014, but I rarely wore them because I wanted to keep them nice. 

Recently (about 6 months ago?), I tried to wear the shoes but no matter how hard I tried, the shoes didn’t fit anymore. :( I was like Cinderella’s step sisters trying on her glass slipper lol. I was devastated! I figured my feet had simply grown and I should give them away. I never got around to giving them away, but today, I decided to try them on one more time. And like magic, my foot fit with little to no effort! How did this happen?! 

In the 6 months, nothing has been done to the shoes and the only notable difference is I’ve lost 5 pounds but I don’t think that weight loss is enough to change my foot size that much lol. I guess it was summer when I tried them on 6 months ago and I usually only wear slippers in the summer so maybe my feet were wider at that time from the freedom of only wearing sleepers?

Therein lies the problem.

You see. I've had in my cupboard a bottle of gatorade. Unopened, fresh as a daisy, though its probably a couple years old at this rate. Every couple of months I brake that baby out but try as I might, I cant open the sucker.

It's stuck! Its sealed in such a way only Thor himself could open it!

My father has tried, old boyfriends, sisters and others. No one can open this damn thing! We are all unworthy. I most of all. If only Thor could see me now...

Chuck it into the dumpster, its purpose gone completely unfilled? 

I can't. Dare I say, I won't!

For years I've followed a scientific path, I took maths and physics as my specializations and by the end of the year I'm supposed to choose what to do next. I was planning on becoming an aerospace engineer, I've always loved space and rockets and I'm deeply interested in space exploration, but I've also been very creative my whole life.

The thing is, I'm confidend in succeeding to become an engineer, and I know it'd allow me to have a nice salary, but I also think I'd be way more happy as a photographer or a filmmaker.

2005,CasualConversation,"Working in IT support is stressful, but rewarding","Goes without saying from the title, but I work in IT support. Networking, to be exact. Just had a pretty rough day today but I can't imagine myself doing anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

For starters, remotely troubleshooting almost anything IT related is hard from the troubleshooter's perspective. Think of it like trying to tell a mechanic what's wrong with your car over the phone and the mechanic has to figure it out with only ""when I start it it goes brlbrlbrlbrlbrlbrlb then dies"". You get it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, when you have a particularly tricky problem that you really nail it's super rewarding. I'm not sure how to describe it, kind of like solving a puzzle? I can only compare it to getting the weird thing that was stuck in your teeth forever finally unstuck.

I used to get angry at myself for all these feelings n stuff.. i legit thought i was cookoo.. but i wasnt sure and assumed it might go out on its own.. but guess what!!.. it didnt!. But know i know that I need help and ive even found a good therapist close to my place i can go to. The problem is just that I cant tell my parents I need help. The thing is Im really comfortable when im with them ( I actually stay in a hostel near my school and not with them ) and everything seems to go away. So they dont have the slightest clue that i need help. But ive been trying to tell my dad for weeks now. I just cant bring it out of myself for some reason.

So if I want 8 hours of sleep (I cannot function on less, to my dismay) I have to get to bed by 10pm. 

This means I need to start winding down and getting ready for bed around 9pm. 

This means that if I get home at 5:30, I only have 3.5 hours of time.

I requested a starting wage of $14.00 if I were to go back, simply because I was already trained and had previously worked for them for one year with no 90-day raise. They said no, because of course they did, and offered me $13.00 instead. I said I would think about it, and looked around for more jobs.

I wound up applying to Chick-fil-A, where I was offered a starting wage of $15.00 with benefits. After some additional digging, I found that most of the service jobs you’d expect to pay minimum wage were paying several dollars above it, while almost every veterinary job I found was paying minimum wage, or just barely above it.

So, in this dream basically, (I don't remember correctly, but maybe I was on the receiving end, or more like I was looking things from her perspective.)
So, they were kissing, and I remember thinking
That this is what kissing should feel like, the warmth, the love, the craving for more. This is how it should feel like, this is what kissing is. I remember thinking this.

Some context : I have kissed two guys, and I didn't like it, I was just like ""eh. Wut. No.""
I don't feel sexually attracted towards women, I mean I haven't tried dating women, but I know that much.
I don't mind the gestures of kissing or anything, but i haven't really thought about that, and I do admire women, and respect them a lot too. But I don't find myself looking at them and wondering what must it feel like to kiss them or something.

Can't go out much or socialize (not that I actively do) cuz of college rules. For the past few days, the world has just been flowing ahead around me. So I've been thinking in the meantime, whiling away some of these mundane ass hours on reddit, Netflix or just spot jogging or music or writing something random. Something dreadful struck me a few minutes ago, I dont have and have never had shower thoughts. I just wash up and get out. I talked to my friends about it and they say, unless they're in a hurry, they always slow down and think about some weird shit while under running water. Thoughts?

2074,CasualConversation,Is this a normal reaction to a picture from my bf camping trip,"I (27 F) am in a long-distance relationship (27 M) for now over 7 years. We are in different countries and with Covid we don't see each other that much anymore.I know it's hard, but we talk all day every day, and we love each other so much.
Lately, he started going camping with a bunch of friends on the weekends. So we stop talking for about 24h or so.


I know it's going to sound stupid but I kind of don't like the fact that he's going to disappear for 48h to 24h hours with people I don't know. But I try to be supportive cause he really enjoys it.

But It's really hard to hide the fact that you don't like something to someone you love. He always says that I don't ask questions and don't look interested on his trips...

So yesterday he was sending me pictures of his weekend, and he sends me one which is literally a close up on female friend's ass and he was on the back ground and he said ""look at my ass I lost so much muscles I really need to workout"".

At first I was confused because I really didn't see him on the background so I told him that I didn't understand, is this some kind of joke. He then said to look at he's ass on the background.

I kind of start seeing red and told him that it's hurtful to send me some chick's ass. And he said that he did nothing wrong. He's not even the one who takes the picture, and he don't understand my reaction.

I told him then to stop sending me pictures and I really don't want to know.
So he told me to stop being dramatic, and he had enough of my mood and sarcastic comments each time he returns from a good weekend.

And that he loves me and he doesn't want to live in a dramatic and stressful relationship.That I need to change my behavior and be supportive. Or it's going to impact our relation and it's gonna be the beginning of the end.


I just want it him to tell me that he understands why I am feeling like that. But he insisted that I was trying to make him feel bad.

I am not normally the jalouse type. So I really don't know what is going on with me. I just know that I really feel bad and guilty

2077,CasualConversation,i have a theory about transphobia,"its 2022 and still this gender-identity/transgender thing is a big mess. lgbtq+ activists are trying to fight for the rights of their people while all the transphobes and homophobes are fighting against it and its all just a mess. but i have a theory. (for context i am 15F and cis)

 so i had this experience when i was in preschool. we were gonna go get lunch and we were in two lines, boys in the other line and girls in the other. i was standing in the girls line and suddenly i was like wow its so nice being a girl. i felt very proud about the fact that im a girl, i kinda like ""felt"" my gender. 
later (i was like 7-8ish) my mom was telling me about genders (shes kinda a transphobe but i think she was lecturing me coz she knew that the world is changing and she wanted me to be succesful in todays world) so anyway, she told me that some girls want to be boys and vice versa. and in my mind i returned to the moment in the lunch line. and i thought: so not everyone feels like that. some feel like they wanna be in the other line. and that made sense to me. then my mom said that some people dont have a gender and they dont want to be neither boys or girls. and i was like mhmm so some people in the line wouldnt want to be in either one of the lines. and it all made sense to me. 

so i felt my gender being a girl and some people feel it being something else than what they were assigned at birth. but what if some people dont feel their gender. and im not talking about feeling like you have no gender. what if they cant feel gender at all. and these people obviously cant understand all this trans and gender-identity stuff. so what if this is the reason transphobia exists and in order to get rid of it people shouldnt preach about all these genders and sexualities and instead people should teach others that some people can feel gender and some cant.
 its kinda like colorblindness. people would be preaching about all these colors to colorblind people but no one ever tells them that they cant actually see all colors. 

so thats my transphobia theory and if anyone read this far please tell me if you can feel your gender or not. id really like to hear.",Decesis,1641293676

I won’t stereotype... but any person that chose to stay in the High IQ Society (small club really) long term has some serious power dynamic issues with no regard for emotional intelligence. To be fair, the IQ really doesn’t matter a lot. You are not less of a person because you couldn’t fit the stupid triangle in the pattern. Taking the IQ too seriously is a problem. I’m convinced that if you need everyone to know your IQ is 140+ (for example) that you aren’t really smart enough to understand that the IQ does not hold up as a relevant tool to put everyone in a box. There are so many factors, it’s wild that people take the IQ so seriously. My point is, if you happen to have a high IQ, I’m here to tell you that we ain’t shit.

2084,CasualConversation,Clothing stores that use floor-to-ceiling layouts should arrange things so that clothes for smaller people are actually within reach.,"Like stores prepare floor plans, but I don't think a lot of them think about things vertically.

I'm 154cm. I was at Uniqlo earlier today doing some shopping, where they typically have two tiers of racks for, say, shirts, and realised it's an all too common experience where the clothing I want in the size I want (XS\~M depending on brand/location) is higher than I can comfortably reach. Best case scenario, there's a staff stool or stepladder I can discreetly borrow. Or I *might* be able to stand on my toes and just touch one end of the clothes hanger so I can wiggle it down. Otherwise I need help.

I guess that it makes sense for stacking shirts to do it smallest to largest, but you'd think that when it comes to hanging up clothes, it'd be better to have the larger sizes up top and the smaller ones lower, where the people who are more likely to buy them would be able to reach.",F_Halcyon,1641286685

2088,CasualConversation,26F Looking to chat,"I've been in the hospital (once again) since late October, to keep it simple: I had growths on my pelvis that turned out to be a form of bone tumors, and quite a lot of them. I ended up having to go through a Hemipelvectomy to remove my pelvis and the affected tissue to stop any spread, and to just save at least some of my pelvis. This was followed by a form of colostomy to do some rerouting.So now I am spending my days recovering, doing PT, and starting to be a bit more social again.

For those who don't know me. Hiya its nice to meet you all. I'm Sara. I was born without legs and a few fingers and due to a generally fucked up medical history I lost my hands and recently 80% of my pelvis. I try not to let it stop me doing what I love, which is mostly reading, playing some games (still working on regaining dexterity for them) and a few other minor hobbies including rocketry, candlemaking, and baking/cooking.

What brings me to reddit you might ask, well there's a few different things.

The first being just to meet people and make friends. I have no social life outside talking with the nurses atm, so...

The second is to talk to other amputees, and those with BIID, I just like sharing my knowledge and experience and helping others where I can.

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly, Roleplaying, My libido has taken quite the hit(literally) and so I haven't had any incentive to RP lately, but I'm taking external estrogen, and its hit me pretty hard, so I'd Love to play &lt;3

I’ve always been that family member. Pushed to the side in favour of my older brother, chosen last after all the preferable people were taken. I watch my dad go through the same struggle with his parents, only to repeat it with me.

Since I started working in the creative industry, I try to respect intellectual property, I respect how much resources, time, and how many people worked together to make a movie/tv show. But despite having subscriptions on Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ accounts, some movies I wanted to see this week are still behind another paywall. (Even on Hulu, you still have to pay for another subscription INSIDE Hulu for Star, on top of what I'm paying??? I'm sorry, what?) Seeing that it's not on any of the services that I've subscribed to really makes me feel disappointed.

I really couldn't justify paying $3.99 per movie on top of all the subscribed streaming services I already have and ended up just looking up where I can watch online for free. It doesn't make me feel good. I don't know if I support some kind of a monopoly on one company/streaming service that would have everything humans ever made, but I was thinking it'd be nice to just have a one-stop-shop where I'll pay $50 a month and have access to all the movie, TV shows I could ever think of.

But it bothers me, it hurts me because she took me for granted like this. I calm myself by thinking that I'm a better human being then them. The lockdown time when we used to talk I miss those times, it hurts how close we were at that time and now we are not. The worst part I think is that I maybe be bothering this much is because I think the worng person is getting his way and I think I deserved to be in their life more than him and maybe I'm salty seeing them happy and normal.

When it comes to fighting depression, I think it's important to do the bare minimum and do it consistently. That's so darn difficult most days when you're dealing with those debilitating feelings though.
When my depression is at its worst, my bedroom is a wreck. I realized a few years ago that - even if my room is disgusting - I feel slightly better when my bed is made. So I aimed to make my bed every day. But eventually that became too much. Now I make my bed in the perfect way,  and sleep on top of my comforter using a different blanket.  It helps me because I look at my bed and think ""Even if I have accomplished nothing else today, at least my bed is made.""",sweetnothing33,1641275543

2111,CasualConversation,Car insurance makes me want to scream,"This is a lengthy rant about the struggles of car insurance. Writing to get it off my chest. I been in stress and near despair at this point, running around in circles and having nights of no sleep. I crashed my car a few days after Christmas, lost control, and slid and hit an empty car. Left my contact info and insurance and filed a police report etc. Parents knew and checked it out. I’m still under their insurance and the car isn’t mine. The damage wasn’t too bad on either car, a cracked bumper on the other car. My car had taken more of a beating with the windshield wiper fluid container being busted open and the front right bumper/headlights being severely cracked. Far from a total loss. In hindsight the car was likely drivable, however with a mountain of snow and my first time being in an accident, I didn’t want to risk it driving it to a shop yet. We went to the insurance and called for a tow. 

Now, I’m in limbo. A middleman hell. This whole process has been a nightmare and I can’t tell who’s right or wrong anymore. The towing company was supposed to tow it to our shop of choice and my stepdad went with a very reputable shop that he trusts. It’s 20 miles from our house. Instead, the towing company picked up (9 hours late by the way) and exclaimed that they couldn’t drop it off at the shop until they got payment from the insurance. My stepdad and I were confused… this wasn’t a shady back deal. This was a reputable insurance company. So, they took it 40 miles the other way. The next few days were frustrating. We had to hound the towing company and they kept saying that they couldn’t tow it until they got paid by the insurance and that they needed authorization by the insurance to take it out. We were made the middlemen to the insurance and the towing company. We had to call for and between the insurance and the towing company to communicate. How ridiculous is that?!? However, the insurance used a vendor to dispatch out the towing company and the vendor is the one who has to pay. So, I have been jumping through hoops, going back and forth with messages, and going nowhere. Telling the insurance what the towing company said. Then contact the towing company and so on and so forth. Everyone tells us different things. Why is my family the one juggling contact between everyone? 

The stress has been getting to my family. I hate to see my parents fight because of me. My stepdad especially. We went to the rental cars and he asked me to stay in the car. 5 minutes, he comes out and asks me if I HAVE A CREDIT CARD. I don’t. I only have a debit card. He goes off on me. He called me embarrassing and useless. I was shocked. I thought he was mad at the car rental place and we would have to fight tooth and nail for a rental. Inside I asked him what was wrong, he said stop talking to me and talk to them. It only ten minutes to do all the paperwork and drive it off the lot. He sped off the lot. We haven’t really spoken since. This was also the same day my girlfriend and I broke up. So, I’m not ashamed to admit I cried on the way home. 

Now it’s been almost 8 days. The towing company is asking me to contact the insurance to send proof of payment to send the car out. 15 phone calls later (10 from me and 5 from my stepdad) and my stepdad is going to threaten to change insurance. The insurance adjuster is asking for pictures of the car which I can’t do since it’s 40 miles across the state. The repair show is asking and waiting for the car. I have been so stressed the past week. People tell me I should be blessed that I walked out of the car fine and I am grateful but if I would have known we were in insurance hell, I wish things would have been different. More importantly, I just want my parents to be relieved of the burden I put on them. They don’t deserve to be stressed because I fucked up. Feels bad man. 

TLDR; Crashed my car, been stuck in bureaucratic hell with insurance. Parents don’t deserve to be stressed because of my mistake",Nooblord54,1641271420

I've been dealing with depression since I was 12, and in high school my grades tanked not only because my depression worsened, but because my family was having a lot of problems. I started going to therapy, and for some reason, after a pretty standard session I felt much better for whatever reason, and it was like someone slapped me awake. Of course I still deal with some ups and downs, like right now for example, which is why I'm writing this post. 

Since my grades were below average but still passing, I can't get into any college I want so I'm taking the next 2 to 3 years to work and pay for college. But here's the thing. I want to do so much, go to new places and meet different people. I'm afraid that, I want too much in relation to my actual hability. Years of dealing with depression left me with pretty heavy brain fog and dissociation. It makes me truly believe that everything I want to achieve is too far for me to grab.

2165,CasualConversation,"I’ve been real sick, and my normally rude dog hasn’t left my side","Now, Rebel has been my best friend for about seven years now. While I have three dogs, she was always intended to be “mine” as opposed to the family’s. And ever since that day when I brought her home trembling in my arms, this little dog has been an anxious little snot and I love her so much.

You might think, “how can a dog be rude?” She’s not outright mean or anything. But like, she’ll come up and sit with you, but if you move a fraction of an inch, she’ll get up and sit at the end of the couch, back towards you. She’ll turn around every so often to see if you’re still looking at her though. 

Or she’ll pick a fight with another one of my dogs, who’s six years her junior and about four times her size. Rebel will just keep pestering her over and over again until Callie moves the slightest bit towards her, which Rebel LAUNCHES backwards to hide behind me. [who knew such a little dog could be so aerodynamic?]

She’s still a lovely little dog, and though I’ve worried if she really likes me at all I love her to bits.

Anyway, to get to the point - I’ve been NASTY sick for the past three days and it’s got no signs of stopping. I don’t often get sick, and when I do my dogs usually pay no mind. But when I stumbled into my room Friday clutching my chest, there was one little dog at my ankle. 

Since then, Rebel hasn’t left my side at ALL. [As I type this, she’s under my elbow in bed!] I was worried about her, so I made sure to give her opportunities to leave and all, but she chose to stay with me as much as possible. She’s also a lot more protective of me than she normally is, barking at anyone that comes into my room [who she normally loves]

Anyway, I’m sorry to ramble. I just love her so much and I don’t know what I did to deserve such a good little dog",heirofvoid612,1641243382

when i am home it's usually for a few-5 hours a day during the middle of the day when my mom is at work and my dad is working at his desk. this is the only time i get to make my own food and have control over my diet.

i haven't had decent healthy food in a minute bc i had to spend a couple days at my bf's house bc he was sick.

i just made breakfast. had to be quick bc i gotta take my dog on a walk soon but it was still good.

i made a breakfast sandwich with a multigrain english muffin, a little mozarella cheese, a little bit of some real ass honey mustard, everything bagel seasoning, an extra large egg and a slice of tomato. i also sliced up some extra tomato and put a little seasoning on it and ate it bc im one of those weirdos who love that. and then i ate a banana.

not much but i still appreciate. i love eggs. i loooove fruits and vegetables. not so easy to be in control of your own diet when you don't have your own kitchen. my parentd barely let me use the kitchen.

i can't wait to eat healthy every day some day. it makes me feel so much better. especially my digestive system. which i have problems with on a daily basis. it also helps my depression. i love to make sure i have variety when i eat so i can have a more balanced diet. i can't wait to have that constantly some day.",bridgeb0mb,1641241213

2180,CasualConversation,Feeling unappreciated/invisible at work,"I've been at my current job for over half a decade and  for the most part it's been fine. Some ups and downs but generally good. I love my coworkers and consider many of them friends (we've hung out outside of work in non-covid times and still do so virtually now), but there have been a lot of times over the years where I have felt entirely invisible.

Since the beginning I generally get skipped in pretty much all of our work-place traditions. When people at my company reach five years working here they get a small present as well as a card signed by everyone. People get small cakes for their birthday, little gift baskets when someone is having a baby, stuff like that. But for some reason I always end up getting over looked.

My five year was skipped, even though a coworker that started the same day as me got the normal stuff. The closest to the normal birthday stuff I've gotten was a sticky note saying ""happy (belated) birthday"" on my computer a week after my birthday.

The one that has kinda hurt the most was when I got married. It was very small private ceremony (really just my husband and I and a couple friends to witness) so it wasn't a big thing or anything but I was (and still am, he's the love of my life) very excited about it. Coincidentally, my one supervisor was also getting married within a couple of days from when I was in a similarly small ceremony.

For him a lot of us pitched in on a gift card and got everyone to fill one of those virtual cards things to congratulate him. Nothing big or fancy but something we all wanted to do to let him know we were thinking of him and happy for him.

During that time I caught myself thinking a couple times ""no one's going to do this for me are they?"" And I ended up being right. I got a couple ""congrats"" when I mention that I got married, but that was about it. And even though I knew that was going

I don't want gifts or cakes or anything, I just want people to notice that I'm around outside of when people need my help for something or they want to hang out. And I feel so selfish and ungrateful for feeling this overlooked. I keep wondering if it's me? If I have the kind of personality that people can't stand or if I've done something my coworkers hate or that everyone actually really dislikes me?

2187,CasualConversation,"I'm about to apply for a job in a field that I am passionate about, but have very little professional experience with.","When I was younger, I used to write almost incessantly. I had more than a few teachers encourage me to pursue it further, but I ended up putting it to the wayside in favor of other interests. Well, lockdown threw a big-ass wrench into those other interests, and I graduated in 2020 with a virtually useless degree and a crushing sense of ""lostness"". As a way to fill the void, I picked up writing again. And just like that, the passion returned, as bright and fervent as ever.

Recently, I came across a posting for a writing job with a video game company whose work I enjoy, and their office just so happens to be less than an hour's drive away from me. It's almost too perfect. So, I've spent the past week cobbling together a few writing samples and composing a cover letter.

I grew up with the notion that you cannot simply leap headfirst into a new career. I thought that you needed the degree in the field, the contacts in the field, and that you basically needed to spend years in the field before you could actually *work* in the field. This is the first time I've really taken a chance like this, and it's honestly nerve-wracking. I don't think it's the possibility of rejection that scares me, but rather I'm afraid that it prove to me that leaps of faith really don't work out, that you truly are trapped into the first path that you choose.

Recently I was talking to some people on my debate team about what animal we all would be, and when they were discussing me, I was super surprised by what traits they felt were most important! It made me really happy, since they were all traits I really try to embody, specifically in the context of our team, so it was awesome to know that I’m perceived as the sort of person I strive to be. At the same time, those traits still feel like aspirations, rather than realities for me, if that makes sense.

My husband when I randomly came downstairs, “You’ve got such a good aura.”

however, I do have some concern. the majority of my poems are very dark &amp; deep. they aren’t about hope, but are more about my battles with depression, grief etc. with an intent to remind people they are not alone. and to hopefully give some of a voice to people who can’t express what they are feeling.

but because of the depth and “hopeless” feel of them, I worry that they could send the wrong message &amp; make people already in a dark place spiral deeper. I plan to put a trigger warning/ disclaimer at the beginning of the book saying that the book contains triggering content, along with a page of resources for people who are struggling.

It's soul-sucking because none of what I write is *really* meant to be useful or helpful. It's all about generating clicks and how high you rank in a Google search. Nothing else matters.

And then they tell me to match that sort of authority despite the fact that I can't lie and say I tested these products when I didn't. Instead, the editors have a guide of ways to ""make it believable that you ACTUALLY tested the product (even if you didn't)"" – that's a direct quote from them, btw.

The annoying part is that I want to be good at my job, so I'm doing my best to do all this stuff. But geez, it's a trip. 

The more I do this sort of work, the less I trust anything I read on the internet. Beyond the obvious that anyone can lie, it's impossible not to think about the fact that so many product reviews and other supposedly informative articles were written by weirdos like me who don't really know what they're talking about.

Anyway, I realized this isn't much more than an ""I hate my job"" rant, but I do think it's almost comical how this mundane job toes the line of ethicality.",Jazz-Jizz,1641224960

I usually am totally ok with being by myself.  But this last week I feel like I am starting to crack.  I can barely keep my focus at work.  I find myself doing nothing but watching bad movies and scrolling reddit on the few hours I have off.  I've hit exhaustion but can't even sleep anymore.

I think I would like to pick an indoor hobby or something up.  I am normally the outdoors type.  But truth is, I miss connecting with people.

Anyone else out there?  Feel free to bring absolutely anything to this conversation.  Ideas, hobbies, personal emotion?  Hell, just talk about your day.

However, the job is fully remote so I interact with them very little - many of us are in different timezones, and we all work on slightly different things so while we have meetings every now and then, we work fairly independently.

I'm starting to find this really lonely, to the extent that I'm considering changing jobs just to be around other people at least a couple of days a week (at least when, in a few months, that'll be possible again). I used to have a job that was way more social (to the extent that it was sometimes hard to concentrate in the office), and I really miss just having casual chats with my coworkers throughout the day, and being able to share the ups and downs of whatever I'm working on without feeling like I'm disturbing other people with IMs.

I can’t stand the first day back to life after the holidays. The pressure is so immense. 

Somehow, the pandemic has made me develop even more profound e-mail anxiety and the thought of the bill reminders, circling back, grade and class related material, meetings, job applications, work questions… Its suffocating 😅

When struggling financially as I power through school, it’s hard to face that stress every day — know it’s scary and not good news and just squeaking by. 

Deeper into the pandemic being personally connected and available on the internet has gotten to almost a phobia (sans Reddit, bc this isn’t an account actively linked to others and i can operate in anonymity without the eyes of peers or feel the toxic vibes of FB, IG). 

I’m burnt out. I’m overwhelmed. It’s like since COVID, we became ultra-available, ultra-connected. Even more than we already were in 2019 with wearable tech and smart-everything. There’s no excuse now to not be able to drop everything and attend to whoever demands your attention. I struggle to reply to texts, respond or read the flood gate never ending stream of emails that always seem to carry bad news or are about stressful topics. Everything is so loud, fighting for attention, and forcing us to live in a digital and physical world. Burnt. Out. 

It’s a weight on my chest. This is always an anxiety inducing night, but two years into Covid and struggles beyond the pandemic is making it terrifyingly numbing and suffocating. Just frozen by dread 🤣

The only reason why I'm back is because I've got one more year of school (yr 12) so there's not point in switching school especially cause I have trouble making friends. 

My dad is a really good person and is trying his best to make sure I feel better but since I've been back everything feels negative. The weather is awful, I miss the happiness that came from everyone and everything just feels so god damn depressing.

2276,CasualConversation,Does anyone else just not participate in conversations even with friends for whatever reason?,"ive been hanging out with friends lately both irl and online ive noticed that i barely participate in conversations. its not that the conversation isn't something that i want to participate in, in fact i like talking about all sorts of random things but when in a group i noticed i just keep quiet and listen to people. i honestly find this very enjoyable, it's kinda like people watching but you get to know about their thoughts and opinions about all sorts of things too. sometimes people just also start talking about things that i dont know a single thing about and its very interesting when that happens.

on the other hand, even though sometimes i want to participate in these conversations, i find myself being overly conscious about the things i say especially about things im knowledgeable about. when i was a teenager i used to say a lot of really stupid stuff that even ruined some of my relationships, so as an adult ive been trying to be more careful, but its gotten to the point where i'd rather just not say anything in the fear of sounding like an arrogant smartass or a complete idiot.",Aliez_2513,1641197760

2281,CasualConversation,Frustrated with the Lack of Male Contraceptive Options,"I recently started dating again. I was pretty happy to have someone in my life after several years of single life. She's wonderful and I enjoy spending time with her. However, when it's time to get it on, she doesn't like condoms. I have no problem with them myself, but sometimes I'll lose my boner putting one on. I don't know why, I also get really nervous putting one on for some reason. Anyway she started to go on the pill recently and started to have headaches and nausea. I guess that's normal, but still, I wish there was something I could do instead of just wearing condoms. I know there's this product called [Vasagel](https://www.revolutioncontraceptives.com/vasalgel/), I would be willing to try it even in beta mode, however it's not approved for use in the US and probably won't be for the next forty years or however, long it takes for the FDA approve it. I know there's a male pill that's being worked on as well, however that is also under trials and looks to be along the same timeline. I've thought about getting a vasectomy, though I'm only 27 and I know most doctors are not will to do one on patients below 30. I'd kind of like to just get it over with so I don't have to worry about accidently knocking her up. I did the pullout method with my ex for years and that seemed to work though, it was super sketchy and I had a lot of anxiety every time. Ugh, freaken biased FDA.

2286,CasualConversation,I tossed a book out my car window,"I’m just looking for a place to tell some peeps my little story, hopefully you’ll find it enjoyable. 

I work at a restaurant for the moment. I’m 22 and have started to read a lot. About a month or two ago I picked up A Brave New World, for Christmas my mother gave me a hard cover edition unknowing I even had the book. 

There’s a girl at work, who I think is really amazing but it’s kind of impossible for any future between us to form. I’m not looking for a relationship but I do like this girl and just enjoy every chance I get to talk to her at work, but we keep it at that and it’s fine. She’s 28 and is perusing a masters degree in marine biology which was my first major.

Anyways, I remember her telling me how she loves reading. I get off work as she clocks in. Sitting in my car I notice I had my old copy of A Brave New World on my passenger seat. My crush had parked right next to me and I got the idea to toss my book out my window right at the foot of her driver side door. You know, maybe it fell out of a customers car who parked in that spot after I left?

The next day we both arrived for our shift at nearly the same time, I’m walking to the restaurant when she calls out and asks if I put a book by her car the night before. I was playing dumb and I’m pretty sure she knew. She brings up how she loves books again and we start talking about how our cars are both two years over inspection. At that point I give myself up and ask if she’ll read it. She said of course without hesitation and thanked me. 

This was new years eve and I worked that shift with the goofiest smile. If things were different I would be head over heals for this girl I like to think that she is somewhat interested in me as well but that’s just a nice thought I have.

This may not be too interesting but it’s always nice to hear peoples thoughts. Thanks for reading!",billybonesjonesXVII,1641193557

Going through trial and error with different meds but nothing so far. Had to switch to homeschool basically because stress and lack of sleep from school was hurting me even more. Before I started getting the migraines in early October I was a mostly straight A student other than calculus which I had a mid B in, but now I feel as if I’m getting behind in school compared to everyone (I’m in 11th grade). Now I have someone come to my house 3 times a week for a few hours and she’s great but sometimes I miss just having a good education cause this is pretty much nothing compared to school I was in before. I want to go to a nice engineering school near me and have a well paying job at some point but I’m worried this is delaying my graduation and hurting my math skills because engineering is very math heavy.

2293,CasualConversation,I finally got to go to a NYE house party…. And I feel so sad.,"Growing up I’ve always admired all of my popular friends back in high school and college, when they have these fun looking parties and friend get togethers for these holidays. Never was a social person to strangers at least and never really felt like I was in the inner friend circle with my friend groups before.

Not much has changed now that I’m a grown ass adult, but I’ve grown much more mature and accepted this sort of lifestyle. I enjoy my me time and wouldn’t sacrifice it for just anyone/thing. But in the past month or two, I re-connected with a friend of a few years and went out for drinks with her and her best friend a few weeks ago, I had a blast and it was a ton of fun (esp for someone who doesn’t drink). 

We talked a lot more and it felt like the friendship was definitely getting better and I was looking forward to seeing them again. She ended up inviting me to a mini NYE get together with her and her best friend. I finally felt like, hey I get to do something for NYE instead of spending it alone, so of course I accepted and was looking forward to seeing them again.

A few days passed and while it got closer to NYE, more and more people got added to the get together, all of their close friends and cousins etc. I already started getting more anxious since it’s a ton of new people, but since I already accepted, I thought why not.
By the time NYE rolls around, there were about 6-8 people there, only one which I knew. But everyone else were like life long friends and unfortunately every conversation just felt foreign to me since they all talked between each other and never really included a chance for me to chime in. I already felt socially awkward enough, so time passes. Haven’t really talked to anyone, including my friend and decided fuck it I want to go home. I got up and left 30 min before NYE and drove back to my city and spent NYE alone again lol.

But I’ve learned that I much rather just spend it with family or myself than with a bunch of people I barely know. 

I hope everyone else had a great NYE though. At least I did get to see the fireworks when driving back.",steven_at_work,1641192270

2296,CasualConversation,I've rejoined reddit so I can try to make amends with some redditors,"I took a break from uni temporarily a few years ago due to some stresses. I began developing religiosity during this period and one of the things it motivated was a desire to eliminate time wasting with reddit being a major source.

I started by removing useless subs, subs that would regularly produce similar content etc, until reddit became so boring and I got sick of certain aspects of it that I was able to delete my account and quit.

During my journey I also realized I had some apologies to make with people in my past. I've gotten to a point where my to-do list is just people I have no way of contacting but I thought maybe I could try finding those handful of redditors I made posts about. Unfortunately I posted on a cringe sub a few times and I recall 2 of them seeing the post.  

So here I am. I sent one DM so far with no reply and I'm looking to see if I can manage to find the others, maybe via a r/whatisthisthing style sub.

I look back at my past self sometimes and compare it to the changes I've made. I have no idea how I could fit in my past skin today yet I managed to for those past 1.5 decades. In fact I feel a sort of disassociation with who I was in the past as if it were another person.

I'm happy though. I stopped a lot of bad habits and small things that are normalized yet cause us to be impacted across a range of degrees.

2320,CasualConversation,I just wanna go home,"My quick background: I'm a Russian 20-year-old guy, I was born there and spent almost all my life in Russia. When I was 15, my parents and I started visiting Finland every few months and by the beginning of the pandemic, I had visited your country 5 times.

Then my parents immigrated to Finland but I stayed in Russia because I was gonna move to Canada soon. And I did, 5 months ago when I was 19. 

It was my own rational decision I made at the age of 15. I chose country, city, university and program. I had a specific plan for my future. I even visited Toronto when I was 17 to make sure I made the right decision (I did). I was so fascinated by Canada as I never was by Finland.

Because of all this covid thing, by summer 2021, the last time I visited Finland was July 2019. At the beginning of June 2021, I was waiting for my Canadian study permit, I was so excited about my immigration and I did want to move! 

Then Finland lifted some restrictions and I was able to visit my parents in Finland before I move to Canada. So I went there at the end of June and spent a month and a half in Finland. I just lived my normal life in my parents' apartment, and when it's time to move, I felt so... upset. I wasn't ready to leave Finland. I didn't wanna pack my bags and I didn't wanna go to the airport. Everything changed in my mind for no reason and all I wanted was to stay in Finland.

I thought it was a quick weird period and everything will be alright soon, anyway I couldn't change anything so I finally moved to Toronto.

For the first 2 weeks, I was quarantining in a hotel and cried every day. Yeah, I was literally crying because I missed Finland! I didn't miss my parents (although I love them) and I never missed Russia. I missed FINLAND.

It's January now, 5 months have passed since my move. I'm used to Canada, I'm used to my residence, I like my university and I enjoy my program. Nevertheless, I still cry sometimes. I still miss Finland and I want to come back. Canada is not my home. Neither is Russia. Finland is what comes to my mind when I think about home. 

Yesterday, I looked at the street views of my parents' town on Google Maps and I had a strong feeling I never experienced before. I felt like that town was my home. Everything was so ... native? Imagine you're an international student who came back to your lovely home city for summer vacation. That was what I felt. Coziness, comfort, calmness.

I would like to transfer to a Finnish university but there is not a single program in English suitable for me in any city of the country.

That's all. There is no end to this story. Just another sad evening when I cry thinking about Finland and wanna speak out.",ukowne,1641185413

2327,CasualConversation,Advice on dealing with jealous people?,"I'm in my senior year and consider myself to be a laid-back, non-malignant dude. I treat my classmates with respect and don't think I've ever put anyone down so far. In one of my classes, I have a dude who I'll call C. He's on the quieter side and we share a few classes, so knowing this, I'm always kind to him. This involves me saying ""good morning"", and ""see you tomorrow, bro"". Just casual, polite remarks. He nods and smiles in return so it's obviously taken in a positive way.

Recently, I got accepted into a competitive college. I told a few close friends about it, some of whom also share class with C and me. Unfortunately, news kind of spread a little bit, and now, people who I'm not really close with, including C, found out. Recently, I searched my name in the class group chat just for shits and giggles and saw a buddy of mine casually mentioned how I got in and that he's happy for me (he wrote that a week ago).

C saw the message and instead of just ignoring it or being respectful of my personal life, was astonished I got in and said ""no way \[my name\] got in. He's so lax in class and never does much."" My friend jokingly replied that I was actually smart and deserving of it, and C still couldn't believe it and said ""he just jacks off during class"".

Honestly, I would've been indifferent towards it if it weren't for the fact that I've been nothing but respectful to C. If anything, I should've stopped sharing the news after celebrating with my 3 close friends and family. I never knew that telling a few school buddies could trigger jealous reactions like this.

Then I got to thinking, holy moly this man was born in 1922. NINETEEN TWENTY TWO! He was born 14 years after the wright brothers flight and witnessed humans landing on the moon. He witnessed the end of ww2. The birth of the computer, the birth of the mobile phone. Going from walkmans to ipods capable of carrying thousands of songs in an unimaginable small area. The internet maturing to a degree that one can want something and have it at their doorstep in a day or two by just clicking their mouse 5-6 times. A huge mass of people collaborating on an insane amount thanks to the internet. He witnessed the independence of India (where im from). 

This got me thinking that yeah, we live in trying times with very high racial tension and of police brutality and covid and whatnot, but it is sorta comforting that we arent unique in this and we have the last century as an example of crazy-ness, if that makes sense.",AgentK1309,1641182481

Last year I dated and had a gf for the first time in 6 years. Went terribly broke up, still close friends for now, made more friends gained new hobbies learned to be actually vulnerable and ask for help!

And allowed the help! Learned to be self centered but uh a bit too much now. Need to pull back a lot tbh.

So this year. This year I need to do a multitude of things. I need to not let the past define me, I need to let me define me. The me who is in the now. The me who will put him self out there, who breaks down his comfort zone to try and try again. The one who says fuck that looks fun I've never tried this before might as well give it a try etc!

This year I want to get a full time job.

I want to move out of home

I want to continue my figure skating journey not thinking going professionally but making friends and having fun

Want to have move fun hobbies

I'd love to lose another 20 kgs or so, am 95kg now was 140 this time last year

I want to date again. I'd love to actually get into a proper relationship with someone rather then a proto relationship I felt lol.

Can anyone share a story of kindness, love, or just enjoying what is worth enjoying in life? I'll even share one of my own stories.

A few months ago, we had an emergency health issue with our dog. All of our living expenses, combined with the fact My husband is the only one out of three of us currently working, meant we had to pay the bills or watch our baby suffer. A friend of my husband heard about this, and just...gave us a hundred dollars out of nowhere. He knows my husband is at breaking point; since then, he has done so many kind things to help him. He knows my husband suffers, and asks nothing in return.

2336,CasualConversation,Is the thing where people never communicate on TV based on real life or just for the drama?,"I'm not neurotypical so I understand I approach communication differently than NT people do. So I'm looking for some NT feedback.

I know I'm not the first one to notice that in movies and TV shows, SO much conflict could be avoided if the character just engaged in some basic communication with each other. Sometimes the whole conflict is based on a misunderstanding that could be cleared up by one sentence, and it's very clear what the misunderstanding is, but they never just say the sentence. I'm sure a lot of this is to draw out a storyline, but sometimes it seems so extreme. Like no one would let a whole relationship be destroyed when they could have quickly and easily cleared things up.

I know that there are people who struggle with honesty, with being vulnerable, with knowing/expressing their needs, with even admitting they have feelings. But media makes it seem like that is the norm. It's presented like most people can't handle communicating at all, until something reaches a tipping point and it all comes out.

2355,CasualConversation,The Hobbit movies are better than I remembered.,"I recently revisited the hobbit movies, some of which I've barely seen since release. When they first came out, I progressively hated them more and more as I constantly compared them to the original lord of the rings trilogy. I hated that they were cheesier, less epic, and filled with needlessly cgi orcs instead of costumed actors. 

However, yesterday I finished battle of the five armies,  and the trilogy is okay, and even pretty good.  There are things that are still cringy, like the Alfrid character that is just obnoxious,  and the dwarf/elf love story,  but there's a lot of good too. Gandalf,  Bilbo, and the dwarves are all awesome. Watching Elrond, Galadrial, and Sarumon take on the 9 was awesome. Legolas was a good addition. Smaug looks and sounds great. Overall,  I like it and I've completely changed my tune on the trilogy. 

I think my expectations at release were high,  expecting another cinematic masterpiece like the original trilogy. The hobbit trilogy isn't even close to being that good,  but is still a fun ride for 3 movies. 

I suspect this is what happened to people with the star wars prequels as well? I'd love to hear others' thoughts on this,  or if you've changed your opinion on any movies/ series.",Datdoe1,1641172942

I stoped cleaning others people's dishes, about a week ago. So they are piling up. It's pretty fuckin gross. 

I lived for almost 3 years in a house with no dishwasher and hated doing the dishes. 

One of my responsibilities at my job is cleaning dishes\cookware. 

She said she was going to talk to the land lord about it. But tbh I'm just going to bypass all of that and just pay someone to come fix it. 

Honestly it makes me upset that she honestly thinks all those dishes are mine, when in reality I've cleaned all my dishes.

 It makes me upset that she wants to die on this hill of being primitive and wasting time on doing the dishes by hand. She basically said, we're not getting the dishwasher fixed because we can do it by hand. And I said back we have an automatic washer and dryer for our clothes, we have washers for our bodies, shower heads, instead of you know just getting buckets of water. We have things that help cook our food automatically, like the oven, the microwave and the pressure cooker. 

So it would make sense that we should have an operational washer for our dishes.

I was having this really cool dream where I was some sort of hero in a team with 3 other people. We were fighting all sorts of scary monsters and aliens on a daily basis and I remember as a young kid feeling absolutely terrified of whatever was going on. At some point we were sitting in a classroom when one of my teammates told me ""whenever it gets too scary, remember, shut your eyes really tight then open them reeaaally wide, 3 times in a row"" so I did what he told me, and I instantly woke up.

To this day, after these many years, whenever I'm having a nightmare even tho I'm not lucid at the beginning, I always get a few seconds of awareness where I squeeze my eyes shut really tight and open them really wide 3 times in a row and I've woken up every. single. time.

It really got me thinking about how does this work? Is it some sort of habit my brain has formed over the years? How did it think of the advice in the first place?

I really wanna hear about you guys and the coolest things you've learned  in your dreams because it's just so fascinating to me that things we wouldn't usually think about in real life just pops up whenever we're dreaming. I just love the human brain so much.",IsEveryFkinNameTaken,1641171551

2361,CasualConversation,Got asked for my number by a worker at a Dunkin Donuts and since this has never happened to me I can’t get it out of my mind,"

Title says it all, but I (F21), have never been asked my number or even showed attention by random guys in a public situation. I’ve been fine with it, since I’m both already in a longterm relationship and the fact I hate having attention on me due to my social anxiety. But for some reason I can’t get this interaction out of my head. Maybe because it was the first time it’s happened?? It’s made me feel more confident in myself and I think that’s just making me feel happy inside.

Anyways, I had been in a car for like seven hours for a family trip and at the last stop before getting back to my town I decided to grab a coffee from the Dunkin’ Donuts in the Busy Bee gas station. The guy working the register complimented my shirt (a cartoon Gator Loki) after I had ordered, which made me pretty happy, and was texting my friend who got it for me about the interaction while I moved out of line to wait for my drink. After a minute I saw him out of the corner of my eye and at first I thought he was just going to tell me they were out of what I ordered or something, but then he hit me with the “hey can I get your number?”

I was absolutely shook and shocked, and I think I laughed at little bit? I had such a weird feeling in my chest at the question and since I hesitated he immediately started apologizing for asking but then asked me if I lived in the area 

I can’t remember exactly what I said, other  that I had a boyfriend and I just kept awkwardly laughing. It was also somewhat awkward because there was this older gentleman standing next to me waiting for his coffee lmao. Also it struck me afterwards that this boy literally left his post at the register to shoot his shot lmao. 

After I got my drink I realized my family had gotten in line, so when I went to go join them I noticed he kept looking up and glancing and me and smiling?? 

I think I just keep thinking about it because it just seems like such a surreal experience. Like I mentioned before, things like this never happen to me, and if others do check me out I am so oblivious to it because I’m just trying to get through life being in the background. I know I struggle with body dysmorphia and thinking that I’m bigger than I really am, but I guess this has just been a boast of confidence towards my view of myself. It might not last forever, but it’s a really nice feeling to have 

Also when I told my boyfriend about it he was like “he has good taste” which was pretty funny to me 

I think I might also be feeling a bit guilty because I keep thinking about it? I don’t know, has anyone else gone through a similar thing or am I just weird lmao",SGRainz,1641171012

2378,CasualConversation,"This toy sounds like it would've been really fun, why do you think it failed?","I (19M) was just reading about this line of toys Microsoft made in 1997-2000 called ""ActiMates"". These were basically talking, interactive plush dolls of popular children's TV characters from PBS. The seven characters released include:

* Barney from Barney &amp; Friends (1997)
* Arthur and D.W. from Arthur (1998)
* Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa, and Po from Teletubbies (1999)

The dolls initially cost $110 (later going down to $60). When used as a regular old toy, the dolls had various sensors and buttons that would trigger different responses. For example, the Barney doll had a vocabulary of over 2,000 words and was programmed to be able to play along with 12 different games (for example, light sensors in the eyes would make the character play peek-a-boo if a kid puts their hands over the eyes), and sing along to 17 different songs.

But for another $65, you could buy the ActiMates ""TV Pack"", which was a hockey-puck shaped transmitter that looked kinda like an Alexa. You'd connect this thing to the composite video output on your VCR and set it down near the TV, and if you were watching any Barney &amp; Friends, Arthur, or Teletubbies VHS tape released at the time, it would send radio signals over to the doll to make it talk and sing along as your kid watches the show.

What makes it even more cool is that they also encoded the ActiMates signals into all live TV broadcasts of these shows on PBS. If you ran your cable TV connection through your VCR, you could watch live episodes of these shows on TV and the transmitter would actually send signals to the doll, just like it would if you were watching a VHS tape.

But after being on the market for a year, ActiMates sales started to decline and Microsoft eventually discontinued the dolls in 2000. Starting in late 2000, new Barney &amp; Friends, Arthur, and Teletubbies VHS tapes would no longer be ActiMates compatible, and live TV broadcasts of these shows on PBS stopped being ActiMates compatible as well.

2379,CasualConversation,"What clothing colors,patterns,trends do you think we will see for men and for women in 2022","My guesses

Women: Dark Red and Wine Colors especially with jackets. 

Colored Chrome with jewelry. I think black chrome, teal chrome in particular will be big hits.


Men: 

White with patterns (plaids, polka dots, etc). White flannels seem to be becoming a thing. Expecting the black and white color combo to make a statement for guys next year

Pastels. I think as men realize that being male is a spectrum more men will be open to going beyond the standard colors and neutral colors in streetwear, especially t shirts. Esp blue, yellow, green and pink pastels


Styles:

Women:

Sweaters

Rompers

More bold colored leggings

Non silver Chrome colored jewelry, accessories 

Vests

Athletic hats

More natural colors




Men:

Suspenders

Overalls (non blue)

More patterned button downs

Increase in men wearing jewelry.

Flannels in non red colors

Vests

Plaid dress pants

More funky colored/patterned button downs

So I had just waken up very early in the morning, light is coming out of other rooms in the house and my door isnt fully closed, I realize that I can't move at all but I am fully aware that I'm awake, of course i get scared and start having crazy thoughts, suddenly this shadow ball starts evolving next to the door, I know Im awake but I'm still having trouble focusing and I constantly get brain-ache? IDK some sort of brain pain I have when I'm experiencing a sleep paralysis, I then close and re open my eyes and boom there's this almost 7' tall spongebob doll with long legs and boots and is dancing that sort of horror movies creepy dances and is slowly coming towards me, my heart is beating as fast as a formula 1 car and I'm literally panicking so hard because wtf is that thing coming towards me??!!! I keep trying to close my eyes but the thing is im too shocked I rather keep an eye on wtf is coming towards me than act asleep and face the consequences so it keeps coming and coming and suddenly I start hearing some creepy violin instrumental just like on those insidious movies and spongebob makes a sudden run and lunches on me then I jump out of my bed fully awake and scary spongebob vanishes, cool experience but also not very cool.",Kingofmybrain,1641161696

The lady wasn't happy about it. She said it was very rude to ask people about there age, and she told me it while I was standing behind a bunch of other kids. 

Looking back on it, it wasn't my problem. Back then I probably thought it was my problem. I think the lady probably knew that I never knew it's rude to ask for someone's age, but no adult ever told me about it earlier.

i have always been on the move and always changing my career and lifestyle around. i have lets say a pretty *big* fear of commitment when it comes to my life and where i will end up. 

i have wanted to be 100 things but never commit to it because i talk myself out of them for one reason or another and there i am again just floating along until i catch something momentarily and then drop it again. 

ive never actually accomplished anything besides barely graduating high school many years ago. i have nothing to really show for myself. 

on October 30th 2021 i finally got a place of my own and i set roots a little. a big part of me is itching to just ditch a rooted stable life and keep hopping around. but a growing part of me keeps wanting to stay put and put in the effort to start a dream job. but since ive never really followed through with quite literally anything, idk where or how to start. it seems scary and daunting and it scares me to the point i dont try and want to get in my car and drive til the sun goes down and start over wherever i end up, and keep doing this forever so i never have to confront it all. 

i want to get into the tech field very badly. i want to do computer programming or cyber security and get out of a never ending cycle of jobs i hate to pay the bills. i want to be happy at work. i want to look forward to it. i want to know im doing something i enjoy and make money from it. i dont want to be trapped anymore and i dont want to fight the process.

For starters, I know I've levelled up this year. Birthdays shouldn't be about whether people remembered them or not. Over the years, I've come to think that birthdays are a gauge for where you are as an individual every year.

This year, I feel motivated as ever to chase my goals. Despite the fear of covid since I have co morbidities, I am optimistic for this year. I'm going to be an uncle sometime this year, and I can't wait to meet my niece/nephew. I'm going to have the job I wanted this year, i know it in my bones. Last year, I missed out on some of my goals. This year, I'm going to have the conviction/no bs attitude to get them done.

And I am going to be spending the evening today with my family, who I'm grateful for. Thanks to covid, going out is risky, but I'm glad about the effort my family usually makes for me on my birthday.

I talked to the gentleman and he told me he was from Cali and I introduced myself and we talked for a little while. He was very kind and grateful for my help, and thanked me multiple times.

I felt good about it. I didn't do it for a reward or anything, I just did it because it was the right thing to do.

Later in the truck on the trip home, my father told me off for calling them ""old people"", completely ignoring the fact that I had helped them when they clearly needed help with no reward for me doing so.

It was like he was trying to take away from my big nice deed with one petty small detail that I didn't even really mean.

Also, HE was the one who told me NOT to help them when they clearly needed help, and on top of that he didn't bother to jump in and help when I did, he just continued to worry about his ""precious"" technology that got wet because he decided to dally about and leave at the last minute when it was raining.

I'm not going to let my petty father take away from my nice deed. 

I helped people who needed help; and he didn't (and he told me not to help them)

2458,CasualConversation,Today I had verbal altercation with my dad and he left home angrily and it shit-scared me,"""Every Happy Families are alike, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way""

-Tolstoy

So currently you are listening about a story from a dysfunctional Indian family.we had money, degrees and everything....but as a family what we don't have is happiness.

So Today in the morning I and my mom had an altercation with my dad and he left angrily keeping his mobile switched off.

When he did not come back after 13 hrs we were very Anxious and was thinking about going to the police.

Our family has a history of mental illness...my grandmother had undiagnosed clinical depression and she committed suicide.My dad too has Depression.My sister has BPD and I am Type 2 bipolar.

So after 6 hrs he gone Miss first thought came to my mind that he has definitely commited suicide...

But fortunately enough he did not ..we found him chilling with his friends in the saloon.

Now it may sound a happy ending but it isn't...

Now a days I and my dad is frequently having altercations.In my childhood he has worked outside my hometown as a banker.So untill my class 12th I did not really know how he is actually as a person.But after retirement when he started staying with us I soon started to realise he is quite abusive as a husband (I do not want to go into details).

But in the society he has a very good impression. Everyone knows that he is a good person and he does 'plinathropic' things all the time...for others...But believe me he is terrible as a family man.He just cares about his reputation.This all philanthropy he does is not something inherent, it's just a PR Stunt for him.I have achieved things in my academics but he never praised me for that but he praised the whole world.He is just a horrible Egomaniac person

And today he again proved that again.I am now 22 and one day I will be dad ..but I won't do this to my child....who the fuck does this horrible shit....I am still shaking...I thought he committed suicide because of our altercation 😖",bipolar_babu,1641144471

It started off with some really poor writing and entries about dogs, but then it got pretty good. For one, there were numerous warrior cat fan fictions in there.

As well as some ripoff clans, some of which being “swimclan” and “stalk clan” 
   
Although I’m pretty sure I lost brain cells reading it, it was pretty funny. It was kinda sad to see how much of my innocence, imagination, and cheerfulness I’ve lost.

2468,CasualConversation,"In California, everyone consistently speeds 10-15 mph over the speed limit. I'm not exactly sure how to feel about it.","In California, especially on highways and freeways, when there isn't traffic, people consistently break the speed limit, with no evident repercussions. I'm not sure if the statistics reflect that this causes more or less crashes than elsewhere in the country, but from personal experience, I feel no less safe on a California freeway going 80mph than i do in Arizona or New Mexico going 65, mostly because I tend to focus on going a similar speed to others around me rather than any specific speed.

I'd think that this ""they can't pull us all over"" attitude would extend throughout the US due to the stereotypes about Americans, but i haven't seen this blatant mass speeding behavior in other parts of the US, or in other countries.

My explanation for this is that cars now are better than they were, so they can take turns at faster speeds, brake better, and are safer in crashes than before, and this increase in speed is a result of people feeling more confident behind the wheel, combined with a general lack of enforcement when it comes to speeding on California freeways. 

Applying this creates issues, though, since the speed limits are, at least theoretically, there for a reason. This mass disregard of them means that either the speed limits truly shouldn't apply anymore, or maybe should be adjusted for current automobile technology, or that we are ignoring an important safety feature in our automobile infrastructure.

Said goodbye to my gf at the time and family and told them all I loved them as I was convinced I was going to die.

2474,CasualConversation,Need help over a toxic friend circle,"

This friend circle is 5 years old. It started when I moved to a new city for work and hit it off with a guy I was living with. My flatmate had a few friends from college who were in the same city and I really hit it off with them as well.

The problems started when my flatmate started seeing a girl three years ago. She has a lot of problems like short tempered and fighting over the smallest things. She regularly insults and emasculates my flatmate in front of the entire friend circle. Coming back to me, she doesn't like me because my flatmate and I used to be close and he was in a way influenced by me. She wanted to replace me entirely in his life and made it a point that my flatmate and I didn't spend any time together, and my flatmate obliged.

I believe she is also a free loader. She would try and always come out on top financially. Like she stayed with us for a year and never paid rent, when asked to pay she would just lie about her financial situation and my flatmate knowing that she is lying would still support her. All of this really affects me because I know what is right and what is wrong.

Whenever we go on a trip, all the plans would be according to her and if they aren't then she would throw huge tantrums. All the people in the group recognize her as a dishonest and tough to be with kind of a girl but don't really speak up because nobody really wants to get into a screaming match and wants to be diplomatic.

All of this affects me a lot again and all my vacations turn out to be more frustrating than relaxing. As you can see this group is becoming more toxic than friendly.

So, my question is if I should move on from this friend circle? They are not doing me any good and they are affecting my mental health. The reason why I'm asking this is because I have devoted five years to these guys.",OddUmpire8756,1641139610

I could probably work 20 hours per week and it would be sufficient to keep my job and be considered a good performer. Why can't I just do that? I work remotely, so I suppose I sort of could. I wouldn't be truly free from work, though.

I went to speak to my manager about it and he told me that somebody had already called to report this alleged “tomato abuse”.",La_Puta_de_la_Fruta,1641123388

Your positive comments inspired me. Thanks a lot!

I fear I'll forget to come back here, so I thought I should share my journey every year until Jan 2031.

It's 1 pm 2nd Jan in India as I'm writing this. 2021 was full of ups and downs but turned out to be better than 2020 for me.

I couldn't add much wealth. Though started giving more attention to health and realized happiness is a state of mind. Here are the three awesome things that happened to me in 2021.

1. **I got into a prestigious university:** Earlier in 2021, I felt down for getting rejected from all the top US colleges I applied to. Later, I got accepted to my dream college in India, and I love it here. Amazed by the opportunities and talented peers I meet here. Soon, I'll be leaving home to move on campus, and can't wait to see how the next four years there bring in a change in me.
2. **I started working on my tech startup:** In mid-2021, high school got over, and I started building up my product, which later got selected for incubation at my college and will be funded once I turn 18. Can't wait to build up a team that grows this together.
3. **I learned a LOT:** Learned technical skills and real-world skills from mentors, peers, VCs, and communities. I was so happy to be able to put in hours learning something valuable other than academics.

Goodbye 2021, what a fantastic year!! Looking forward to socializing more in real life and reading a lot in 2022. Those are two of my personal goals. Also, I'd love to hear awesome things that happened to you in 2021 and your goals for this year. Feel free to write :)

2506,CasualConversation,have you ever driven a drunk person home that didn't give you directions.,"(right sub i hope, i've moved away from 3 others) 

i only do delivery, but someone came up to me and all impromptu asked me to drive them home. their nye was ""not going as imagined"". they were having a rough day and i guess they just wanted to go home. 

which i could have done for them had they just given me an address. if they really wanted to get home they would have just told me their address but they were being closed off about it. i don't get it. is that a thing drunk people do.

they're all ok about just off the cuff having a stranger they don't know drive them home (hitchhiking), but giving their address (or even just a place near home) is too much for them.

 i know people try to be safe and all with their info but i naturally avoid being paranoid about my information like that. i wouldn't care. just drive me home. i'm not distrustful like that. 

they mentioned to me in passing while talking that they ""had a bit to drink"".

are drunk people this difficult and incoherent when you're driving them home? i was more or less feeling standoffish myself. them not giving me an address had me suspicious this could've been some elaborate scam somehow. 

but here i am alive and well. whatever.",Legionnaire333,1641120058

For me, I’d say few things have my interest like food and selling goods (separately). I’d love to own and run a food business that actually serves people the right way with decent prices and good food in good portions and quality.

Selling goods meaning that there are many great products out there that I believe in and would love to one day be the go-to for people to get them from me. For instance, I’d love to be one day a business owner selling some entertaining and useful electronics like digital watches or bluetooth speakers or digital frames for pictures. I don’t know, I feel that I genuinely want to be able to serve people with things I believe in and know that it would make their lives better and happier and a little easier.

2523,CasualConversation,Whats the longest you've gone without steady employment?,"      I quit my job just before the start of the pandemic in 2020, I was finishing my college degree at the same time as well and my plan was to give myself a breather before I commit to finding my full time career. At the time I was thinking a few months off between jobs, but as it turns out its been about 2 years since I've had a job. I've had little side hustles here and there and gigs come along to help ease the bank account. But its to the point where some days I feel like a useless bum, and other days I am hopeful I'll finally land that dream job.

     To this day, I've probably sent out 300 applications and about 40 interviews (usually multiple screenings) or so and that is not an exaggeration. It probably doesn't help that I'm only applying to out of state positions, because I am trying to escape my current living situations. In addition, I'm not just trying to get any ol' job, I am still hopeful I will find a career role I can grow into and support myself financially. But that hope is withering away rapidly and I don't know how much longer I can go on.

This last Thursday night, she was vomiting and had severe abdominal pain, up all night, and couldn't eat anything. Same Friday without the vomiting. We finally convinced her to go to the ER this morning (another horrifying layer given covid exposure risk and her health) and my sister spent 11 hours with her waiting, then in a room while they ran tests and finally prepped for emergency surgery. My sister finally went home to eat for the first time and got a call just 90 minutes after she left the operating area that the surgery was successful, my mom was still intubated and asleep, but she pulled through. Then just a few minutes later she got another call which was worrying. But it's just to say my mom woke up and was talking normally, let us know her room number and that she'd be able to come home tomorrow to recover.



My mom has been sick all my life with cardiac and lung issues. When she gave birth to my sister, she went into a 3 month coma. I've called 911 for her several times since i was young.

A couple weeks ago, he said he was busy and stressed with work but wanted to hang out more after Christmas maybe. At a certain point he kinda stopped answering my texts.

Today, he finally answered and said he was just feeling like keeping to himself, but would reach out to me if that changes. But at this point I don’t have much faith in that actually happening. I hate this weird split between not answering texts, but like literally the last text I got was him saying he wanted to keep in touch and hang out more later, giving me that little bit of hope.

This isn’t the first time this kind of thing has happened to me, or the second, and it’s really frustrating.

2626,CasualConversation,Heartwarming Moment at Work,"The other day I had a very nice moment at work and I decided to share this with anyone who sees this.

So for context, I am 22 and a male  Registered Massage Therapist (RMT) that has been working for 2 years and 2 months. As you can imagine, there are still a lot of stereotypes associated with my work, especially since I'm a male. had a few clients who refused treatment and walked out because they didn't know I was a male. Or how we are only in it for touching women. many more but you get it. I've had plenty of nice heartwarming moments with clients because of how I can help people but this one took the cake. 

I have a client, whom we will refer to as C1 (Female), came to see me a month ago from a referral (referral is Latino from Venezuela and has been sending me their family and friends since they know a lot of other Latino's in the city I live, somewhere in Canada). C1 has now sent me their husband that we will call C2 (Male). Gender is important. I saw C1 a few times and then C2 a few times after that within the same month. 

Last week I saw C1 again and she told me after the treatment that C2 was not going to be coming to see me again, I got a little anxious as to why but she then told me he just cannot stand being touched by another man. I was a little disappointed since I saw him twice and he seemed to be enjoying it. She then told me that he was very grateful for everything I did for him but the male-male touch was too stressful. It turns out he is from an *EXTREMELY* old-fashioned/traditional family in a small town in Colombia. His eldest brother is gay and they had to move elsewhere because being gay there is very dangerous. She told me he really liked me as a person/therapist and that he was actively trying very hard to unlearn/breakdown all the toxic/unprogressive things his family coded into his brain as a child. He was very grateful for everything but because of his upbringing, he ""naturally"" would get very stressed by another man's touch. I told C1 to tell C2 that I was really proud of him for coming to see me and happy that he was trying so hard to change and that if he ever wants to try again, even for 1/2 sessions, that he is more than welcome to. The look of pure joy on her face was priceless and she was very grateful. 

This made me feel really good because a lot of the time people come in for something physical and it is rewarding. However, when someone comes to try and make themselves a better person by trying new things and being open minded/breaking down social or familial barriers it just feels really good.

2639,CasualConversation,I've reached my dream body today,"A few years ago I said to myself: ""I'm about 6 ft tall and want to be visibly fit, healthy and strong, that should equate to around 78 - 80 kg bodyweight, that'll be achievable.""

Today I'm still that height, hovering around 77 to 79 kg at quite a low bodyfat, 12isch %, went to the gym consistently, made my progress while lean bulking from a starting weight of around 67kg. I looked in the mirror just now and I just smiled, all that I wanted was in front of me: abs, vascularity, feeling healthy.

People always say once you achieve a goal, you just crave more but though I won't stop working out now, I feel like I'm fine now. Much more and I'll be looking way to swole for my taste.

Ghosts are nowhere near as harmful physically as real people that are alive currently. 

I would rather much stay in an abandoned so called haunted house any night, over a bad neighborhood on the streets all night with high crime.

Let's face it. People suck sometimes. So with all that in mind I'm no longer watching any kind of film/documentary/show etc on the matter of ghosts any longer. 

The idea of it just seems scary. But in reality when approached head on it's a walk in the park in comparison to true crime of reality.

2683,CasualConversation,The Squirrels Are Hungry," The morning rituals hereabouts include morning coffee and feeding the squirrels.

We feed the bluejays too, so when coffee is prepared, the customers are often lined up on the back deck rails, waiting for breakfast. Coffee is put down on the big table, and whoever's out first opens the little metal trash can on the little table; in it is a bag of sunflower seeds (for the squirrels) and peanuts (for the blue jays) and little piles of these treasures are put along the back deck.

Then we sit down to drink the coffee and energize for the day ahead. And the birds and squirrels tuck into the morning's bounty.

But this morning was New Year's Day, and we were not up as early as we might have been. Plus, it was snowing. So we got up, we made coffee, and we stepped out into the cold morning air. The birds and squirrels were not there, having given up waiting.

But when I looked at the little table, where the can sits? There were numerous little squirrel footprints around its perimeter. FACING THE CAN.

As if a half dozen squirrels had said, ""Well, they're not coming, guys; we're going to have to work this out ourselves,"" and had stood and surrounded the can and struggled to figure out how to get the can open to get the seeds and nuts themselves.

I used to take a big one, hide it in one hand, then take a small one, fold my hands up and “blow” into my hands really hard pretending I was blowing up the bouncy ball. 
Then obviously I’d switch them and show the big ball to him. He thought it was the neatest thing. 
I could also make them smaller again by folding my hands, “squeezing” real hard, and swapping the bouncy balls back. Again, neatest thing to him. 

As my son got older and bouncy balls became less fascinating, we stopped playing with them. 

Cut to when he’s about 8 and he finds the old box of bouncy balls. He starts reminiscing (which in itself is funny when an 8 year old gets wistful about their past) and then asks if I can still do the thing where I make them bigger and smaller again. 
Then he stops and thinks really hard. You can see the wheels turning and then he realizes it was all just a trick.

I don't feel they anymore. Every day seems like a blur of anxiety and desperation.

2738,CasualConversation,Two of my best friends are probably becoming a couple. I feel so happy and worried at the same time.,"So I am a high school boy, and my closest friends include another boy and a girl. We are kind of like a trio, the three of us hang out together quite often, and we have a lot of common interests. I have always suspected that he had a cursh on her, and last night, on New Year's Eve, when I, him and a couple of other friends had dinner together(the girl was not present) he admitted it. He told us he had a crush on her for 3 whole years, which I did not expect, I thought it was more like a few months, and he was looking for an opportunity to confess. Now, I would feel so happy if the two actually made it, but I oddly find myself very worried and afraid. I'm not jealous of him or anything, I do not have a crush on the girl, but I still feel troubled.

The thing is, I have never had a girlfriend, and I doubt that any girl has ever had crush on me, while all the kids at school have been going around getting a new partner every few months. This has always been a pain. Even though I know I should not associate personal value with the number of girlfriends one has had, I can not help it. I feel inferior to them all the time. Worse, I have no real close friends, because they are all too busy dealing with love to care about a single like me. 

This only started to change recently, namely, during the past year. I got to know the two friends. I got to hang out with them, do silly stuff together, and talk to them about these anxieties. And now, they are becoming a couple... and I just don't feel good. Will we still be able to hang out together like before? What would people think of me when they see a socially awkward guy together with a couple? I don't want to be seen as a third wheel, and I don't want to be one. I am sure they will not try to get rid of me on purpose(he told me that), but I fear that I will naturally become distanced since they are a couple and I do not fit in. And finally, I just would not be able to look at them the same way as before. They feel ...different. And distant. Not what friends are supposed to feel like.

See, he was foreclosed on earlier this year. The house was abandoned for a little bit, but I hadn't noticed the silence.

I ignored those around me, because all I wanted was my best friend back. I also spend the summer in a state of depression, which I was told stemmed from dangerously low levels of vitamin D. This was right in the middle of a training course I was doing. It made me give up until the night before the big test. I was sad about guys I had no chance with. I was setting myself up for constant disappointment. I chased after a job that seemed impossible because of my disability, and I was constantly knicked down my others, even my family. Well, heck.

1. Have $10,000 in my checking account

I come from a very low income family who have always had money problems, and I would like to be the one who changes this. I love business and money and I want to be responsible and have my future kids (I’m 20) some day look up to me as a role model for breaking the cycle.

2. Find a girlfriend

We’ve all been there. I’ve been single for too long and I really don’t like it. I crave intimacy. I want to find a girl who I can cuddle under the blankets with drinking some red wine while we watch Disney movies. 

3. The most important one: open up more

I’m not too emotional of a person irl and I’m pretty bad at expressing my feelings. But I really want to tell my parents how much I love and admire them for always believing in me. I want to tell my brother just how smart he is and how he’s my best friend in the world despite all of our arguments where we say petty insults we don’t mean. I want everyone to know what I think about the best of them. I feel like we all could compliment each other more, as this will make the people we say nice things about more likely to say nice things to others, who would then be more likely to say nice things to others, until you realize that you’ve actually made the world a better place by doing so.",jxssss,1641027767

I usually prepare to not sleep until maybe 2 AM on NYE, but these specific loud boom fireworks are being set every 30-40 minutes, waking me up from any sleep-state I may have been in. My family member visiting for the holidays hasn't slept at all and is on pretty high alert, so I've mostly stayed away from him as my reactions probably won't help him much anyway.

So, is anyone else up from fireworks tonight? How was your New Year's Eve? I just stayed home, but I did step out around midnight to watch the fireworks from the yard. Gonna be up till the fireworks stop long enough to get some rest :)",nncnfrms,1641026350

2773,CasualConversation,Trying to find out where i can post this question: Xiaohongshu App - Does anyone know of any possible solution/hack to reading all the posts in Chinese --&gt; but in English?,"i cant for the life of me figure out where i should actually ask this question. Theres no Xiaohongshu app subreddit.

So here it goes, i cannot speak/read/write Chinese in the slightest. But i have been introduced to the Xiaohongshu (aka Little Red Book aka Red) App and its an entire online ecosystem of information that i think is super interesting/useful and a completely different community than other apps like Instagram.

But all the posts are in Chinese, obviously ;)

Like reddit has its own app, but there are dozens of other Reddit reader type apps, e.g. BaconReader.

Why isnt there any way to read Xiaohongshu in English? I've searched online everywhere, and even in app on Red through a friend who speaks Chinese and we come up with nothing.

Im hoping someone here who speaks Chinese / uses Red has heard of / knows of some kind of solution/hack out there for illiterate foreigners who cant speak Chinese to use this app and read the content on the app in English.

its mind boggling to me that nobody out there has created something like an alternative reader in english or any other kind of innovative workaround solution.

Anyways thanks for the time, sorry for the OT and potentially irrelevant post to this subreddit.

(also, i know the ez answer here is to... learn chinese! im trying, but it would be really helpful to be able to use the app in the meantime before mastering the language :?)

During the interview, I was very open of what the salary is, and ask what their expected salary is as well.

My team then sent a letter of offer to one candidate with the company benefits and salary written. This is way above market and above their asking salary with great health insurance.

They somehow replied asking for higher salary and that we should do justice to their experience (fresh grad with only 2 years of experience).

Dancing alone I found myself constantly getting sandwiched between other friend groups and other people trying to maneuver between them. I don't mind a crowded dance floor, but it was annoying constantly being in other people's way, and not having friends to make a circle to dance in.

Getting rejected by girls is pretty standard, but after about three hours of it with no friend group to return to for support, it really killed my mood, and by the end of the night I just felt lonely and like a total loser.

Is this what clubbing alone is like? Most of my friends aroud here don't like dancing or drinking, but I didn't want that to stop me from trying to have fun and enjoy my life. What do you guys think?

2800,CasualConversation,"New Year, First Post Ever","This is officially the first post I would post. Ever. 

Three beers in. New year, new start. Pandemic still rages on. Looking broadly, there are countless shitty insights: climate changes, viral spreading faster, how close the movie Don’t Look Up movie was in parallel with our reality and many more. 

If there is anything that sticks with me, it’s how we choose to live in moments. If anything seems inevitable, no matter how hard we fight, we choose how we want to focus, the hell of reality or the small blessings we’ve taken granted of. Another experience of pandemic has honed my appreciation for connections and friendships to a deeper level; we do need each other, whoever we are. 

I was talking with a friend of mine and we were on the topic of new year resolution. The classic stuff. Some would say to lose weight. Some would go for more adventures or better job. To my friend, I mention one thing, which surprises me, so to speak, and that is to make more friends.

I’m not exactly a social butterfly. I’m a strong introvert. I would opt to be alone much of the time and spend much of my time and energy on projects (much of those are home improvement projects and securing my new job). Pandemic is hellish for many, including myself, but it’s been one hell of a teacher if I may be bold to say so. 

While I plot for ways to connect, I find myself feeling grateful for little or quiet facts:
- my family still lives and kicking
- especially my father who survive leukemia 
- I can still get better job
- my own home
- friends who I can see and connect
- kindness still exists in hidden or overlooked places 

This is the new year. If I am to control my life and my destiny, it’s to find people who I can vibe with, regardless of my disability. Even if we don’t connect well, that’s okay because I’d be honored to have that experience. I’d be humbled to be given precious time and energy.

It’s not that I don’t have any choices in terms of entertainment; it’s that I think there are too many. We all do the thing where we scroll through Netflix for awhile and sometimes don’t even choose anything, but for me, I get this feeling that I make the wrong choice even if I really like what I’m currently involved in.

For example, I just did it with music. I was just walking on a boardwalk in NJ and wanted music to fit the mood: rainy, foggy, deserted, dark. There are bands I know and playlists I have that fit the mood. Yet, each time I chose something I’d choose something else a few moments later. I loved what I was listening to. But for some reason it wasn’t enough and it was frustrating me because it just didn’t “feel right.” 

It’s also why I have so much unfinished stuff on Netflix. I can watch a few episodes of a show (I began Big Mouth recently) and could LOVE it but still switch it off halfway through an episode to watch something else even if I don’t have that something else in mind.

I’m not asking for medical advice, I’m just curious to know whether anybody else has had the same experience.”

Hi everyone, I’m writing out of curiosity here. 
I’ve had allodynia as a side effect to the COVID vaccine(s) twice now, and I’m wondering whether anyone else has experienced this or if I just have a weird response to the vaccine. 

When I got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I spent all of the next day with widespread allodynia - all of my skin - and I do mean all of it - hurt and felt extremely sensitive. Wearing clothes hurt. Brushing a feather-light touch against my skin hurt. It almost felt like my skin was burning, even if I didn’t do anything; it was just extremely sensitive. I had some bizarre chills but not quite chills as well, despite having  no no fever. 

I just got my booster shot today, with the MODERNA vaccine as my third shot at around 1:00 pm. A little less than an hour ago, the allodynia set in again. My skin hurts in places I would not expect it too. It’s a very odd sensation.

I will admit that I have experience with these sensations although it’s usually limited to relatively small patches of my skin, not my whole body, so perhaps I’m simply predisposed to this reaction.",leg-question,1641011607

Vivian Manning-Schaffel was a party girl in her 20's. One new years' eve she had a severe fever (103) and was so weak, she couldn't even get out of her bed. She had to cancel all her plans of going out. This led her to realize that **she was spending so much time and money, ""rushing around town"", to avoid how unhappy she was in her career.** 

She was getting over a breakup and she was facing professional roadblocks. Her body was sending a distress signal and she was kind of ignoring it(FOMO).

**Instead of going out she watched TV shows;** called her mom and her best friend that night. She woke up in the New Year feeling ""tons"" better. She realized - it's fine to miss out on some cocktails as ""**the best way to celebrate anything was to make yourself happy**"".**A New Year's Eve spent on your terms, is a prime moment to reconnect with yourself.**

One of my friends was going to a get together, I asked to tag along but only a certain number of people could go, I asked to hang out with another friend but he just said he was going somewhere, another one couldn’t leave the house because of Covid in his workplace. I’m sure I could’ve tried harder but it felt pathetic and I didn’t want people to think they were my secondary options I guess. 

I just feel like I’m not close with anybody, and it usually doesn’t get to me but on days like today when it seems like everyone else is going out this loneliness is suffocating. At least I have people I can call friends, I just wish any of them would invite me to something sometime. I’m always having to make the effort to reach out, otherwise I’m forgotten. 

I’d kill to have a best friend, not like a significant other. At this stage in my life they seem to come and go. But just a friend that won’t.. forget",daft-sceptic,1641011103

2827,CasualConversation,This poem made New Years my favorite holiday.,"Below is copy and pasted from [this site.](https://twloha.com/welcome-to-midnight/) Hopefully it'll help somebody else. Peace to You, and happy New Years! 

Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.

The ball drops and fireworks. Resolutions are made.
People scream and people kiss and is it possible to change?
Is it really truly possible to leave the past behind?

Welcome to Midnight.

Another year comes to a close. Another year begins.
With a moment in between.
Why the fuss?
Why the fame and fireworks?
Is it more than hype? More than something else to sell us?
Is there something to this holiday? Something true inside it?
Because isn’t there something inside us that aches for change…
Dreams it to be possible…
To let go.
To hold on.
To leave it behind.
To start again.
To be new.
Is it possible?

If you’re reading this, if there’s air in your lungs, then you’re alive today tonight right now.
And who can know how long we have here…
And is it a gift? Was it ever a gift? Did that ever feel true or could that one day feel true?
Are there things to fight to live for?
Moments and people… Weddings and children and all your different dreams…
Love…
Is your life more than just your own?
And are there broken things you were made to fight to fix?
Broken families, broken friends… Injustice.
Will you move for things that matter?

Wouldn’t it be nice if change took just a moment?
Wouldn’t it be nice if it were that easy?
Midnight and we’re new. Midnight and the past erased. Midnight and we’re free.

It seems to come slow. It seems to be a surgery.
Forgiveness. Healing. Sobriety. Letting go. Starting over.
It seems to happen slowly over time.
One day at a time, the choice made new each morning.
Will you fight?
Will you fight to be healthy?
Will you fight to be free?
Will you fight for your story?
Will you fight to get the help you need?

Change takes more than a moment, but maybe there’s also something to this celebration of a moment, something to the way it speaks to us, something to the way we fear it, and dream it to be true. Maybe it’s the most honest moment of the year.

It’s possible to change.

Welcome to Midnight.

Here’s to the possibilities.

Peace to You.

2842,CasualConversation,"12 Angry Men. Meaning of ""Not Guilty.""","In the 1957 film 12 Angry Men, initially juror #8 is the only juror to vote not guilty. By the end of the film, every single juror, who originally voted guilty, has changed his vote to not guilty. Juror #3 is the last juror to change his vote. 

When juror #3, standing alone, is asked to explain why he is voting as he is, his arguments come out as an incoherent rambling mess. He says “I’ve got all the facts right here.” He then pulls out some notes that he took during the trial. Those notes are covered up by a picture of his son. This is symbolism. The picture covering up the notes represent the way that juror #3 projecting his feelings from his relationship with his estranged son is obscuring truth and justice. Juror #3 then tears uop the photo, becomes vulnerable, sheds a tear and says “Not guilty.” 

Juror #3 does not explain why he changed his vote. This leaves us the audience to wonder what juror #3 was thinking biut refused to say out loud. 

Here is what I think juror #3 was thinking. I think that juror #3 realized that the falling out he had with his son was truly his own fault, not his son’s. Juror #3 was embarrassed when his son (9 years old at the time) ran away from a fight. He should have been proud of his son. When juror #3 said “not guilty,” it was a double entendre. It meant that the defendant is not guilty, and his son is not guilty.",bigelow6698,1641005477
2843,CasualConversation,20 Things that make me happy.,"We, as humans, have this bias where we tend to focus on the negatives rather than the positives. This is supposed to be a survival tool to help you improve. However, many people, when trying to improve, have this tendency to develop missing tile syndrome. Missing tile syndrome, in case you do not know, is when, no matter how many things you have going for you, you focus much more on what is going wrong or what is missing from your life than you do on what you have and what is going right in your life. It is called missing tile syndrome, because of an analogy to where you are looking up at a ceiling and you focus on the one missing tile rather than all the tiles that are present. Where this analogy stops being true is, having this attitude regarding ceiling tiles makes sense, as ceilings have the potential to be perfect. Having this attitude regarding life makes no sense, as life does not have the potential to be perfect. I decided to make this list of 20 things that nake me happy. 

1. One of those days, in New England, where it has been cold for several days and, today, it is warm and sunny. I am glad that not every day is warm and sunny, for if that were every day, we wouldn’t appreciate warm and sunny days. 
2. After experiencing a physical pain or ailment such as a head ache, tooth ache or runny nose, my nose finally clearing up, my tooth ache finally going away or my head finally feeling better after the pain killers kicked in. 
3. After I express an opinion, someone else tells me why they only partially agree with it and I realize that this issue about which I have a strong opinion is not as black and white as I previously thought. 
4. When an argument or debate that I have ends with us agreeing to disagree and I realize that different opinions are great and you winning an argument does not mean someone else loosing. 
5. When I think back on an embarrassing  moment from high school and I realize that 100% of the people who saw it, I am no longer in contact with, no one (who is still in my life) has to know, and I feel relieved. 
6. When someone asks me a question that I am embarrassed to to answer, I answer it anyway, because I am morally against lying, and the other person surprises me by providing me with words of comfort and solace. 
7. That feeling that I get after completing a work out. 
8. That feeling that I get after completing a project or homework assignment (this happened when I was in school, which I am not anymore). 
9. When I am worried about doing poorly on something and I surprise myself by doing better than I thought I would. 
10. Seeing a meme about a small moment of doing something that I thought only I did, turns out everyone else does those things too. 
11. My dog. 
12. The fact that I live in the time period that I do. The standard of living for a poor person today is better than the standard of living for a king in med evil times. 
13. Knowing that you have tomorrow off, it is better than the actual day off. 
14. The original Karate Kid trilogy and the sequel series Cobra Kai. 
15. The smell of a brand new pair of shoes. 
16. When I am talking with someone about a pet peeve or inconvenience that I often deal with and someone makes a clever joke out of it. 
17. Entering a warm indoor environment after being outside on a very cold day. 
18. Taking a hot shower, on a rainy day. 
19. Rainy days. They are the ultimate excuse to do nothing. If the new season of a Netflix original series came out and I want to spend the day binge watching it and eating nachos, then that is my choice and I don’t care if it is sunny and 65 degrees. However, if you do that on a rainy day, you can brag about it. 
20. Hugs that are so tight that you feel the other person’s heartbeat for a moment and everything feels so calm and safe, like nothing can hurt you.",bigelow6698,1641004956
2844,CasualConversation,What do you do when youre just plain abnormal?,"This last year has been a rollercoaster, emtionally and eventwise i guess. But if anything its caused me to come to terms with how abnormal or weird i am. I sound like a god damn edgelord teen, i know. 

But i like to think il quite aware of my surroundings and unfortunately i cant help but compare myself to everyone around me all the time. Bad trait maybe but still cant seem to improve myself to a point where i dont do this. 

Disclaimer is that ive drank about half a bottle of carbonated white wine. (And six shots of tequila...) Not champagne because that is produced in the region of champagne in france. The more you know. Like if its not from there it cant be called champagne but i was told if i say champagne is carbonated white wine id probably be killed in the street... lol!

Back to the point if auto-correct would stop trying to change everything to swedish. This year i broke up with a girl and it was rather amicable, i mean eith her new bfs permission i gifted them both christmass gifts and they gifted me back which was nice :) but still i getting that people dont do this. People also presumably dont keep contact with their former mother in laws...

But I noticed my friends weren't even online and remembered they had plans with other people and I wasn't going. I thought it was fine and normal and I started playing Minecraft while listening to a YouTube video, but every so minutes I got increasingly bored of what I was doing and I didn't feel like playing anything else, so I just turned it off and started reading manga and was of Instagram for a long while until they came back at like 9:30 which is pretty late. This happened before when one of my other friends was busy with work so he didn't hop on for like 3 days and on the third day I was sad, tired, and just downright moody but when he started a party I was incredibly happy. I can't go outside so I don't have much responsibilities or anything to do in general so working out, watching YouTube, and playing games is all I have been doing when school is over.

Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're Doing Something.

So that's my wish for you, and all of us, and my wish for myself. Make New Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody's ever made before. Don't freeze, don't stop, don't worry that it isn't good enough, or it isn't perfect, whatever it is: art, or love, or work or family or life.

2888,CasualConversation,Do any men feel... um... inadequate when they can't keep a fireplace fire going?,"When I was a kid, my dad was the master of the hearth.  Didn't matter what kind of wood we had, he could build a fire, light it, and keep it going till the end of the day.  Often with wood he cut down himself in the back yard.

When I build a fire, I feel like it's a constant battle of man vs fire, with me losing from the start.  Doesn't matter that I'm using kiln-dried firewood in an overpriced cardboard box.  It starts to die out, so I re-arrange the logs... and it gets worse.  In the end, I'm left with whole logs, charred on the outside and smoking, but no flame.  No warmth.  Failure. :)

I sit there and look at the spectacle in self-distain, thinking ""But.. but... before it burned through the fatwood kindling, it really looked like it was gonna take this time!""  Now, what I see in the fireplace can only make me think of the words, ""That's OK... it happens to a lot of guys.""

I was so proud of myself for doing it promptly (I was lazy about the 3 inches earlier this week, which meant I had to contend yesterday with the strips of ice where car tires had packed it down.) It took forever, and was exhausting, but mission accomplished, and just in time for the New Year. 

But…now it’s snowing again. And they are predicting another 6 inches. Ugh. 

That’s the thing that is so annoying about snow; the fact that the weather decides when you are going to be shoveling for hours on end. No scheduling it for when it’s convenient, no chipping away at it a little each day. At least, not unless you are willing to pay for your decision in the form of stuck cars or packed ice. 

Also, I have yet to find a way to shovel snow that doesn’t make my back sore as hell. 

I guess I know what I’ll be doing tomorrow morning…

What I wouldn’t give for a snow blower. And covered parking, for that matter!

2902,CasualConversation,Personally I like spending new years alone.,"I'm 20 and a student, however, I hate clubbing and parties. The most I'll do is go to the pub with my girlfriend and/or my friends. I just dislike loud noise, standing around with other people pretending to have fun, and having to take care of drunk people.

My new years celebrations include drinking cocktails made myself in my pyjamas with a candle on my desk and watching videos online. I'll switch over to whatever channel is doing the fireworks for 12:00 though, just feels wrong if I miss it. 

There was such an expectation as a young teenager to want to get smashed every other night and go to parties. I've since learned in Uni that I do not like that stuff at all and would much prefer to curl up into a comfy ball and wait for my inevitable end in a social setting like that. 

There are half-exceptions however. Occasionally if I'm already drunk and someone invites me out to a club, I'll psych myself up to go, get dressed, get my shoes on, and half way there decide to nope out of the situation and run home. 

Maybe an old fashioned jazz bar would be my thing. That sounds calmer and more enjoyable. 

&amp;#x200B;

2909,CasualConversation,My most broken but best new years EVER!!!,"So to start my parents are split but not divorced , my dad has been and still is incredibly narcissistic and manipulative. Well after a recent incident ( I'll explain if you ask nicely ;) ) my mum had enough and he's been kicked out the house and is now ""getting help"" and ""getting better"" with that aside me, my mum and siblings have never felt so free and happy in our own home, we realise just how miserable he made us and how we truly are better off without him. parents splitting isn't great but thing are better with them apart.

secondly me and my partner are long distance, south korea - uk/england kinda long distance, we've been together well over a year and a half, closer to two years now, and have never met but this year we finally had enough money to book him a flight over here and we finally met in person on the 20th, we've spent an amazing Christmas together and he finally got to experience a ""white Christmas"" as he put it XD 

We have so much planned for the month he's here which includes both our birthdays in January but unfortunately after spending an amazing day in my city centre we both came down with covid ): we are in quarantine till the 9th and have had to cancel a few plans which sucks but it doesn't take away from the fact that we are entering 2022 together physically by each others sides &lt;3

lastly back to my dad, I've been following a tiktok account about a man with narcissistic personality disorder who helps bring awareness to NPD to help others who are in a relationship with a narcissist (TT: @ mentalhealness , lee hammock) and I've been meaning to show my mum some of his videos but kept putting it off but I though I don't wanna carry this negative energy into 2022 so I'll show her now, and I did. After a somewhat long talk she admitted she doesn't want him back, she wants him in her past and to just move forward and it made me so happy to hear, I too do not want him back either but will continue to ""love him from arms length"" as I so oftenly quote. Its weird to say but I can't wait till my parents are divorced.

I am a disabled at risk person and I’ve been a shut in ever since pandemic started to protect myself. I have auto immune issues and can’t walk much without an aid (cane and rollator) because of spinal issues but I digress. A friend of mine needed someone to play Santa for her sister’s kids at a small Christmas gathering. Pre covid I absolutely loved her little parties. My husband agreed because the person that usually does it canceled. We asked if everyone is vaccinated and covid free and they were but I guess that didn’t include other illnesses even tho I am fairly certain I have covid now. We get there and both kids are coughing badly and the mother says they have “some virus”, the father of the kids is sick, and her father (the kids grandfather) is sick. I went to hug my friends dad and he says “oh this is the worst cold I’ve ever had you don’t want this” so I am in panic mode internally and stay distant at the gathering but I am thrice vaccinated so I stay. We entertain the kids and share Christmas gifts and my husband dresses up as Santa for them but now I have a 102 fever. I’ve been horribly sick since the 28th and it’s now the 31st. Why couldn’t some of the already sick people dress as Santa for the kids? She is ready to end our friendship because of my “blame” of her family. I told her I couldn’t gotten it anywhere that just for FUTURE reference to let me know if she happens to know if anyone is sick. I think that’s common courtesy! She is calling me rude and disrespectful over and over again today and I think she is being hyper defensive because she knows she is wrong.

If you are friends with the bad guy or guys everything is great, you get fed, your business is protected, but if you're not, you live in constant fear waiting for that heroine or hero to come to town and rid it of the bad people. That's the US, as I currently see it. You know who the bad people are, corporations. You wanna know who the hero is, unions. Walmart should be unionized, as well has Amazon. Hell Walmart and Amazon should band together to shut down the country until they receive a living wage. Create a union and bargain together. If corporations can't treat employees well, then form a union. We have child labor laws specifically to prevent corporations from using children. Nestle argued they can't be sued for using child labor because it wasn't on US soil. Somewhere work became associated with skill or a college degree, think back to when the US was a world super power, post world war 2, everything was made in America, union membership was at an all time high of 35%. When 1 parent could work and provide for a family. Now we have Jeff Bezos and the Walton family killing the whole town.

But even though I’m pretty young (early twenties) I grew up on classic rock, prog rock, blues, pop, sky rock. Basically a large majority of the music I listen to is pre 1999 or so. There’s amazing bands and acts out there from the 40s-90s and I always am diving deeper into that territory. I don’t have anything against newer music, or pop music, but the current sound of pop and most new bands don’t really do much for me. I like contemporary indie adjacent music but it’s so hot or miss. Some newer stuff I like are The Growlers, bela fleck, tame impala, foxygen, dr dog, Tyler the creator, car seat headrest, war paint, mitski. 

I just want to expand my horizons and listen to more contemporary music, regardless of genre or whatever. I feel like I’m stuck in a funk of only listing to older stuff and there’s so much good music but I shouldn’t just write off things that are modern.

You and this guy are friends, you two start developing feelings for each other and you both know you like each other.

The relationship only needs one little push i.e someone confessing for you two to start dating.

Then suddenly this other girl shows up and beats the snot out of him. (It’s not too serious, he’s bruised and bleeding but he can still walk)

You take him to the hospital and tried to cheer him up but it doesn’t work.

For the next few days, he doesn’t answer your calls, doesn’t show up to school, none of his friends have heard anything.

You’re very worried, of course.

Then every student receives a message from an unreliable source (the source is right most of the time but it has sometimes exaggerated the truth. The source’s goal is to create chaos and wreak havoc among the student body) saying that he kissed the chick who beat him up.

When he does show up to school, he goes to talk to you about *something*. But someone interrupted him and asked him about the message. He gets flustered (he *rarely* gets flustered) so you know the message is true.

What would you do next? Stay and hear him out? Would the situation be too much and you ask for some time to think/ calm down?

*Note: this is a fanfic so if it’s sounds weird at any point, it’s a fanfic, that’s to be expected.

And if someone reacts like this I won’t do it again and actually will stop talking to them if I can because that’s such a asshole move it’s not even reflexes they just see it as their chance to hit you way too hard.

And if someone wants to say that I hit too hard but don’t realize it and that’s why I get that reaction I don’t think that’s case. I have nerve damage in my arms and hands like I gotta use two hands to carry in a half gallon of milk basically I’m pretty weak.

Today is the last day of the year. I live in the Netherlands so that means a lot of fireworks around here. I am very afraid of fireworks because I have a neurological syndrome which made my cerebellum underdeveloped. I have a lot of problems progressing sounds especially. 

Fireworks give me crazy anxiety, it's like a fight or flight response with every loud noise and a major adrenaline rush. It's draining all the energy out of me and usually I get a mental breakdown at the end of the day.

I tried to light my own fireworks previous years, so I can expect the sound. But that didn't help. Nowadays I wear noise canceling headphones if it gets too bad. 

The reason why I made this post is that it's almost 4 PM and I managed to go outside for a walk! This has been an issue for so long. I don't dare to go anywhere. I just stay in the house 2 days prior and 2 days after. I was terrified while outside but I still did it!

My husband and I are on a small vacation, hiding in a tiny house somewhere in the woods but there is still a lot of noise from people shooting carbid. Tomorrow I can say I made it through another New Year's Eve!

It’s New Year’s today, midnight struck less than an hour ago. We’re spending New Year’s quietly at home today like last year, as partner’s family doesn’t have a thing for celebrating New Years (I would normally visit family at this time, but with covid I haven’t been able to). I went downstairs to wish partner’s family happy New Year’s, but found out they all already went to bed. 

My family usually does a Christmas/New Year’s party with the extended family (I should say, a numerous one), with a massive feast, games and backyard fireworks. I don’t do well with big gatherings and loud noises, so I didn’t think much of them at the time. But now that I’m sitting alone in my room, hearing fireworks in the distance and neighbours’ celebrating… I kind of miss them. For the first time, I’m feeling homesick.

3039,CasualConversation,is it okay to surprise your parents with something you bought for yourself?,"It all started when I saw a video on Twitter from a crypto guy called TheMoon, This guy bought a Bugatti Chiron and he surprised his parents with the expensive car he bought for himself

when I first saw the video I didn't see anything wrong with it, I thought the parents would just be so happy that their son bought an expensive car and that he "" made it "" in life

but when I read the comments... I began questioning my life

Nearly all the comments were like "" So you surprised them with a gift for yourself? be humble "" folks in the comments were so negative and didn't like what he did

Now, what do you think? is what he did actually wrong?

Because I remember I bought my first car when I was 16, and it was better than my dad's car

When I bought it I was so proud and happy, My dad was happy but he didn't care much and he just said "" congratulations ""

a few days later I asked him to drive it so he can feel how cool my car is ( I thought that me being happy with my purchase = him being happy too ) I didn't take into consideration that my car is better than his, anyway, I asked him to drive it

He said to me in a straight face "" You want me to test drive it? why? ""

I told him "" I don't know, just so you can see how good the car is and I wanna know your opinion on it ""

He paused a little bit and said "" We'll see "" and he never tried it since then

I didn't expect him to react like that, I thought that he would drive it and say something like "" oh my god The car feels great, good job on it "" or something like "" I'm proud of you son "" but he didn't

**I was able to fully afford it**, and I did ( until now after 3 years ) so there is no reason he wouldn't be happy for me on buying a cool car, right?

Here in the Philippines, there are a lot of superstitions regarding the new year and most of it focuses on bringing wealth/luck.

Most people would gather round fruits. I don't exactly know how many kinds. Some people say 8, others say 12. This is meant to bring good luck. (Round is shape of money/coin.)

Red fish. On the 31st is when the market prices on food products such as fish/seafood/fruits go up. This also symbolizes good luck.

No chicken. Chicken is bad luck since they say that the luck will fly away or something like that.

Throw a lot of coins within the house for good luck.

A lot of kids and probably a few adults jump when the clock strikes midnight. They say it makes one taller. Lol.

Make noise to drive bad luck/evil away. Either firecrackers/fireworks, banging pots/pans, blow into a horn (usually kids), or even blowing the horn of one's vehicle. So it is really really noisy. I wonder if it's the same in your country.

Also, depending on where you live, streets will be filled with smoke after. A lot of delayed flights because of ""zero visibility"" due to smoke resulting from fireworks.

3055,CasualConversation,"It’s 3am, I’m in a mood and can’t sleep so I just need to vent a bit to some internet strangers","For context, I live in Canada where elementary school where elementary school goes from k-8 and then high school is years 9-12. 

Throughout elementary school, I was always one of the, if not the most, popular kids. Everyone was trying to hangout and stuff with me. Anyways, COVID came around the year I was finishing grade 8 and starting grade 9 at another school. BUT! 
Because of the epidemic I decided go to school online for that year. That was the year everyone made friends and met new people at high school. Everyone was forming their new relationships. Meanwhile I was literally in my house for weeks at a time, trying to manage a shit ton of loneliness and depression. 

(Important note: during this time, I picked up electric guitar and practiced probably at least 4 hours a day, averaging about 6 hours because I had nothing else to do.) 

This year, I started grade ten. I had always been looking to start a band but I couldn’t find a drummer anywhere, until I did in August. It was literally the happiest I had been since pre covid. We jammed 3 times and it was awesome. Until he ghosted me. -_-

Anyways I started at a massive high school with almost 1000 people, and since COVID came around, I had 0 friends that I would see more than once maybe every other month. Still, if I didn’t ask people to spend time with me, nobody would reach out to me. Ever. So I decided fuck all of those assholes who keep going to parties without inviting me and doing all kinds of other stuff when they all know I’m lonely and depressed. I have been there for each and everyone of them and they ditched me. 

So that’s the lore story but the reason I can’t sleep is because I was just on Instagram and I saw that drummer started a different band. They just released some material on Apple Music and Spotify. I went looking through those photos on their Instagram and they look so happy having fun together and hear I am. Alone. Isolated. I have been working on recording an album on my own for about 4 months now and have pieces of song recorded and written but goddammit if I had three other people working with me and I didn’t have to figure out drumming, singing and bass playing, I would have a killer record out by now.

3060,CasualConversation,2022 yikes," 

2022 in my opinion is going to be a big year for advance technology. Elon Musk is going to start testing his neurolink on human beings. Apple is coming out with the Applecar. elon Musk is going to go further his plan to colonize Mars. And it seems like the powers that be want to merge artificial intelligence with human.

In other words, they want to replace us! I know that kinda sounds like some conspiracy theorist lunatic. But think about it. For decades they have been subliminally programming us for humans to merge with machines with movies like Terminator, transformers, the matrix, etc. And its so happen this year that the Matrix ressurrection is also coming out this year.

The powers that be already have control over our finances, social media accounts, medical and now they want our thoughts, memories, our soul.

An d of course they will always going to give you the benefits of the merge of artificial intelligence and humans. Oh its for the betterment of mankind and so forth.

But it really is total enslavement of human beings. Turning us into robots who just simply obey and command. And the sick part about it now they are trying to reach immortality with AI and technology

I mean who the fuck wants to live eternally in this sick world. I will never allow Elon musk but a brain implant in my brain. If i have a terminally disease i want to suffer and die. Or I want to grow old and die. I earned it. I have no interested in living forever in this shithole of a planet.

And colonizing mars? To do what? Let me guess so I can pay a tax on mars and earth? No thanks. What is so special about this life? To work hard for a system that will eventually enslave us.

Wow I feel like i went full misanthrope on this post. But yea i feel bad for the children born into this machine world. Im on my out of this world. Sigh! This life.",lacottoncandy,1640940400

1. Writing diary…

Diary: Here we go again, you write for two days and then doodle!

2. Working out…

Dumbbells: We’ve been here since 2017…at least clean the dust

3. Bakin-

Oven: Stop right there, you can’t even boil the water without burning the utensil

4. Reading…

Books: Yeah like one page everyday

5. Partying every month at least once

Money: Why does she even try saving?

Alcohol: YAAAAAAAS BTCH!!!!

\*Finishes listing the resolutions and forgets about them the next day\*

If you tell me that you followed and actually were able to complete your new year resolutions Imma say you lie! Why? Cause if you do you must be an angel out of this world.  
New year resolutions are meant to be forgotten…okay that’s a lame excuse. But that is exactly what happens, no matter if you are someone who remembers what happened, where to whom, how a decade ago; when it comes to remembering and religiously following new year resolutions your memory gets shorter than that of goldfish.  
Hey, if you are gonna shout at me for my laziness…in my defense it's WINTER! Besides no one wants to write in the journal that I was working at 11:50 pm on the 31st and got to know it's 2022 after hearing the firecrackers! Once I was so determined to follow my resolution of going on a diet I swear I tried to eat salad but it's not my fault that it comes with a pizza!  
Woh har new years pe extravagant new years’ resolutions banana jaroori hai kya? (Is it necessary to make extravagant resolutions in the new year?) Can’t our resolutions be as simple as looking out for ourselves, taking it slow, stopping multitasking, and being kind? Oh also drinking more water…(not a good idea in this chilly weather though).  
Despite complaining about not being consistent about my resolutions, it always feels exciting to look forward to something new, in the coming year. Cause even though we love the layers, we always wait for the snowflakes to wither and reveal the beautiful bloom of the mango tree. Yeah, my 2021 started off with a really bumpy start but hey, so what I wasn’t able to do the things I planned I still have next year, right!  
2022 be ready, here I come with a whole bunch of enthusiasm, loads of determination, passion, sprinkles of excitement, and a gist of positive vibes and kindness!  
This year I WILL BE dedicated to my new year's resolutions! First stop, working out every day!

\* First morning of the new year \*

Or, just, to throw it out onto the Internet, try to keep it from bouncing around my brain.

I'm in love, and I guess it really hit me tonight. We both said it, and have said it often since. I said it first, and I guess I said it before I really meant it (""I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a gentle sort of curiousity"" said Fitzgerald, summing it up excellently I felt). But I have meant it, and been meaning it, the past few weeks. 

It's really toxic, and I've been working on it, but I have recognized that sometimes I enjoy what I get out of a relationship, attention, devotion, more so than what I put in. But this, without me realizing it, became something where I wanted to bring him joy and make him feel special, more so than craving it myself.

I don't like the person I become in relationships. I'm a romantic through and through, but if I'm not in a good place while it's happening, I lose myself in a relationship. I think maybe I'm scared of heartbreak again, or not being good enough, or reaching a point (like I have in the past) where he's all I think about, and I spend all day waiting for his text, and all my time with him constantly looking for reassurance. I'm not there yet, but I feel it coming.

I don't know. I'm usually really great at expressing myself, but every time I've tried to journal about this or deal with it on my own, I just end up writing, ""I don't know."" Love is wonderful and it is bringing joy to my life, but my stupid brain and tendency to draw from the past and self sabotage is making it stressful, and that makes me sad, because I love love, and I really care about this guy.

3093,CasualConversation,My family and I were almost stranded once.,"In 2016, I was 11 years old and my mom and I travelled up to Fairbanks, Alaska to visit my 21 year old half-brother, his 23 year old wife, who is my half-sister-in-law I guess, and his two children, my 2 year old half-nephew and 1 year old half-niece. It was September, so the snowy weather was beginning. We travelled to a hot springs and on the way back, the snowstorm was rapidly approaching. 
The car had bald tires, and on our way back, drifts overtook our car and we slid out of control into a ditch. Unfortunately, our car slid over a rock and our gas tank was leaking. Therefore, we could not stay in the car. We had no cell service and about 90 minutes before sunset, with the temperature dropping rapidly. Additionally, it was not long until they closed down the highway for the night. We grabbed essentials from the car and decided to head back down in elevation. There were abandoned cabins quite a ways back. For some reason, my half-sister decided to go uphill and took my niece with her. 
I remember asking my mom if we were going to die. She kept responding I don’t know. For me, that is one of the worst things you can hear from your mother, uncertain if you are going to be okay. I was praying that a vehicle would come along and rescue us. 10 minutes later, it was blizzard conditions, and we started heading down. Suddenly, a truck comes along and my mom jumped out in front and flags it down. At this moment, I am on my knees crying with happiness that we were saved. My mom, nephew, and I crammed into the back of the cab and my half-brother climbed into the back that had one of those hard tops. We caught up to my half-sister and she joined my half-brother in the back. My half-niece joined us up front. As soon as we got home, I went into shock and threw up that night.

3148,CasualConversation,I'm graduating soon and I realized how close I was 4 years ago to offing myself,"I and those around me like to downplay how bad the depression was my first year of college. Some will tell me to get over it. But I came really close to committing suicide. I had suicidal ideation; I would think of ways of offing myself. I could barely get out of bed no matter how much I screamed internally at myself to get up. My body just wouldn't budge. It got to the point where I missed class, and missed assignment, I just couldn't function. 

My sister who said she would be there for me wasn't. (She wants me to get over that even though she still isn't there for me like she continues to promise year in and year out.) The phone calls with my dad didn't help at all, all he did was heavily criticize me, which made it worse. 

I had no one. The girls that I made friends with weren't really my friends, they used me for gossip and for their amusement. My judgment was clouded.

I was drowning, and I had no life preserver. It got bad to the point where I was thinking of checking into a mental health facility. 

That year, I made two F's. And then the next year and the year after that I came back stronger than ever, well I still pudgy. But, like mentally strong.

Maybe I should stop downplaying my life experiences. I think I have to because my family does and because of my age.

But you know what? It has a message, it means something. It helps the humankind to realize how stupid we became. And for me, that is indeed something.

See, I'm a 25yo guy based in Spain who decided to study cinema and audiovisual communication a few years ago. And I'm glad I did, I'm working now after a Master's degree, and I really like my job! And besides that, I've time. Free time. Leisure time. And I want to spend it, doing something meaningful. So what do I do? Well, I love to communicate, so I communicate. I ""create"" content. And I love it. Or do I?

I created my first YT channel when I was a kid, and still today I find myself everytime just thinking about new video ideas, new cool effects to apply in post-production and so on. I'm even planning to livestream some games I think I'm wether good at, or can share some happines having some fun on it.

The thing is, after watching this movie, I realiced it just... doesn't matter. Nobody cares.

I want to communicate, I feel that need deep inside myself, not only because I've fun doing it, but because I feel the humanity really needs communication to move forward. And that's the thing. I'm not moving anybody forward.

Since 2010, I've created content about many things: vlogs, travel vlogs, gameplays, storytelling, shortfilms, documentary little movies, spots (ads)... I've created for clients or just because leisure. But the thing is, now that I'm here, what am I doing creating all these videos and livestreamings?

It feels like I (and many more people, maybe even yourself) are creatign for the seek of just that, communicating. Spreading. Spamming. Not having much to say but the same things. Wondering about what if you magically develop a community, if you get that voice you always dreamt about... Even the good and happiness you could bring to many people using that voice.

But what are you gonna say? The same shit?

It doesn't matter, nobody cares.

So yeah, this is me, writing on the 30th of december of a year that's been a madness for us all with all this pandemic thing, taking a moment to think about what am I doing, what is important in reality, what could I do for humankind. How can I help? How can I communicate that thing that I know deserves to be out there making it's way to space to destroy a freaking comet nobody even dares to see yet?

I've been creating for the seek of creation for the past.. Idk, 12 years?

Its about time to start thinking a bit more. I encourage everyone out there to do the same, to stop just spamming. No need to be a content creator! Perhaps you've been feeling kind of this way at home, or at a job... Just stuck, doing things on autopilot, because it is what you do, what you know makes you money to survive and makes you feel the same every day when going to bed. That feeling of relaxation, but uncertainty; pleasure but emptiness.

Just take a second to stop. Look around you. What could you do, within the things that you know, that could make your surroundings a bit better? Make you feel better? Make the humankind take that next step? Make your life meaningful?

What could you do?

When it comes to me, I've some ideas already. I'm not gonna take more of your time at this point, but I can tell you that many of those things start by thinking and spending a lot of time on each, since what I've been doing for the past 12 years is the opposite. Mostly.",GranDemo2,1640905367

I think we should update the legal age to 24yo while adding some layers or a new category for “older children” (rather than “young adults”).",Chamoismysoul,1640905316
3171,CasualConversation,vent about 2021?,"This is my vent about 2021! I built a new app this year called whatslove to help people meet over events. I was very excited about the countdown since covid started to slow down and events were back, then omicron comes. flights and events are getting cancelled again. It’s like when I finally see the end of the tunnel, I am back to square one. Covid is like the shadow I can’t shake off. I am constantly worried about catching it and passing it to other people so I started to isolate myself from everyone. I mean I haven’t travelled and I haven’t seen my family for two years! Mainly because they are out of the country, but still. I used to hate hugs, the feeling of other people’s chests touches mine makes me crawl, now I kinds of miss it ahhhh I am so weak!! I really miss the crowd, hugs and dining inside without the fear. Anyway I am just here to vent about covid, and I am sure everyone must be affected by it big or small. 

So vent! Vent all the negative feelings out! Vent away 2021, and prepare ourselves for a better 2022!

Happy new year to you all ;) !",WhatsLoveApp1,1640905078
3172,CasualConversation,Am I the issue or-?,"Hi, I'm miracle but I go by Mira because no one really believe that's my real name :/, I'm 18 and crap. As you can see I post alot of ""friendship."" Post because I originally joined this app for friends, as a last resort I researched apps to help make real friends and Reddit was one of the apps that came up that I hadn't previously used. So about a month ago, I started using it to make friends and only to make friends. But after being in the social, lonely, meet people, make friends reddits ive made zero friends. 

I've made post in hopes to make friends to meet in real life eventually, call on the phone, send each other stuff, watch stuff together, game together, FaceTime basically in a nutshell a real long term genuine friendship that can work through anything. I personally can't have friends irl where I live specifically, due to a domestic situation, so for 7 years ( since I was 11. ) I've been on social medias trying to make friends to meet in real life and have a real connection with, I've sent people things, been here for people, sent voice notes, stayed up with people, listened to people but all of them found other people, got in relationships and just left and would occasionally pop up to vent or ask for stuff and it sucks. 

I see so many people online say they're alone and want friends like me, but they don't. They just wanna be here and talk which I have nothing against, but when you have no real life interactions, youre just online everyday for 7 years and have no balance it gets old. And that's why I wanted real friends. To have the negative and positive stuff, and work through things together, and a relationship one day to have and watch each other grow and stuff, but it's hard when everyone who dms me is inappropriate, racist, bored, or using me to vent and have no interest in doing what I want to do in a friendship. 

I can't tell if I'm the problem, or whatever but yeah. I was told Reddit and insta and stuff aren't the places to go and try to find friends but Ive tried everywhere and it all just sucks. Sorry for the rant lmao, if anyone does see this and want to be what i mentioned you can dm me! Though i prefer people 17-20 and from the US.

3173,CasualConversation,Is Encanto a bad movie?,"I watched the movie Encanto and I liked it. I didn’t care for the story but I thought the characters were a lot of fun and a couple of the songs were genuinely incredible. So of course I went to text my friends about the movie. Three of my friends are Hispanic, and when I started to talk about Encanto, they got so… angry? It’s like they completely cut me off and started going on about how the movie is so stereotypical and offensive and they hate it. After that they’d go on their Insta stories to trash talk Encanto, and like afterwards they would make fun of me just because I talked about liking one of the songs. 

Is Encanto an offensive movie ? Is it as a stereotypical as my friends claim? Like my friends talk about this movie as if it personally murdered their parents or something. I’ve seen other people online praise the movie for accurately portraying Colombian culture, meanwhile my friends said it’s all stereotypes. I don’t know what to think.",Listless_man,1640904979

Years ago, we flew to Boston to see a major Rembrandt exhibit.  We were at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and there was a good size crowd.  My wife and I got separated, and I saw her at a distance, and she was apparently searching for me.

This wasn't the kind of event where you could shout across the room, and cell phones weren't a thing back then.  So I needed to get a message to her. 

Guess what I did.  I coughed.  After many years of marriage, I knew that when my wife coughed, I could pick the sound out of a crowded room.  We cough using the same vocal cords we speak with, so it's our voice.

She instantly looked me direction.

I think everyone in a long term relationship has had a similar experience, yet I never hear anyone talk about this little nicety of marriage.",jefuchs,1640899548

3229,CasualConversation,Making new friends and relationships are hard.,"I've been feeling depressed ever since I've moved to another country. I'm in the military and I got an assignment to Italy 9 months ago. During those 9 months, I've struggled to make new friends outside of my workplace. My coworkers are not the type to hang out all together after work, on weekends or holidays like other shops do. I'm a timid person (only to new people) and I'm horrible at starting a conversation so I go to bars to drink and look at my phone, hoping that someone would walk up to me and start a conversation. I feel pathetic. Maybe I feel this way because its the holidays and I can't see my family. Christmas was bearable because someone added me on FB and I took the chance to try and talk to them. He invited me to a Christmas dinner with his coworkers and it did a great job taking my mind off of all these thoughts and making me feel less lonely this Christmas.

I honestly feel like this is a confidence and self esteem issue because I went to a Christmas party hosted by the squadron dressed to the 9's and a lot of people were complimenting me. It's probably the most compliments I've got in my entire life! It was definitely a confidence booster but not to the point where I would go up to another person and start a conversation. The confidence/ self esteem boost I got that night made me want to reach out to more people and make more friends.

3240,CasualConversation,(24)My own evolution of understanding.,"I finally gotten out of the whole cemented idea that the people around you are the ones you chose to have in your life.

I get the whole everyone is there in your life to teach you something and wise verca, but I believe its more than that.

Am a very ambitious being, I want to do everything and be the best in most things that bring me pleasure. People call me a very competitive type of person, which I totally understand.

Through the ""short life"" I have lived so far (Like elders tell me every year while my my skin gets rustier), I no longer believe that people who are older than me know all the answers I am seeking myself. 

My ego might be high or my standards/boundaries are high, 

I Live in a world where what I want must happen. 

A world where I choose how to live my life.

A world where it is not as complicated as people make it sound

A world where I give as much as I get although I do not expect anything in return

A world where I am at peace with my choices and past mistakes

A world which is full of lessons and experiences

&amp;#x200B;

I can only have that with myself or likeminded people 

&amp;#x200B;

It is as If they don't want to understand what life has to offer. At least in my eyes, 

Be with people who want the best of you.

Most people will not understand your why. What a shame.. I see the world differently, I give things different meanings than others. I feel alone in this thought but it brings me so much life

We had a gathering planned with a couple of friends but that has now been canceled. I am a little sad and a little mad that this situation happened. I hope his mom is okay. She's in the hospital sick. His dad is isolated alone at his home also sick, but not as bad as to require hospital care.

3243,CasualConversation,Why do some redditors comment on posts that already have thousands of comments?," I wonder why some people still comment on popular posts, knowing they're already too late to the party. No one will read their comment and they most likely say the same thing that has been said earlier and has been upvoted thousands of times. Why do they do this to themselves?

(of course I mean when they make standalone comment, it's different situation when they reply to someone because that person will most likely read their reply)

Usually when the post has couple hundred of comments already, when you comment your comment is most likely to go completely unnoticed - not downvoted, not upvoted, not replied to, no one gives a sh\*t anymore, they moved on to another new popular post that will get littered with comments within hours and forgotten another couple hours later, while the most active part is mostly just the top comments and replies under them, the new comments just sit there unnoticed unless they are replies to the top comments.

The only person who may read your new comment is the OP who reads all of them but I highly doubt even OP would be able to keep up with all the new comments when his post becomes popular and everyone is commenting. I know, because I made some posts that become popular and got hundreds of comments and at some point around 200 I became tired of it and stopped reading all new comments.

So why bother? It's like arriving to a party that everyone has already left but proceeding to still party and dance, but by yourself without anyone seeing you dance.",SUS_pended,1640881052

3246,CasualConversation,About budgeting for luxury/mandatory things in developed countries.,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask. But there's been something I would like to know for quite some time about developed countries.  
So I'm a junior software developer in a developing country earning around 600USD a month in a full-time job. As everyone I also have hobbies, which include programming, gaming, photography etc. But buying essential tools such as a camera, a good macbook, a playstation for those hobbies is a serious commitment.

What I would like to know is, in developed countries is it normal to have a spare 500-1000usd a month to be able to buy those things without it being a big deal? From what I've read about salaries there, I feel like there's no reason for a developer not to have the latest devices such as the ""macbook m1 pro"" in a western developed country.  


TLDR: What's your thought proccess when buying something a bit more expensive in a developed country with an average developer salary?

3248,CasualConversation,Gay/queer telepathy?,"So, my brain felt so tired and just drained from work today. I usually don't go out much to save money but I decided to treat myself today and so I looked for cafe recommendation in my city that's ideally have a quite atmosphere/not too crowded.


To my surprise, there's a cat cafe in my city (there are cats there that you can pet) and I read the reviews and someone said when she went there no one was around so she had all the cat to herself. I prayed I have her luck haha. 


It was quiet when I arrived, just me and a couple however soon enough it became crowded as the place is small. There were me, three couples, and a family with two toddlers. I stayed there because.... Cats, duh! I wanna pet them and be around them, it's calming! And I did a little bit of work there too. 


Around an hour and a half before closing time, these two guys came. I immediately thought, they seem to be a couple. Of course I could be totally wrong but that's just how I felt. Soon after they arrived the family and the othe couples left. 


They seemed very comfortable with each other (in a positive way! There's just no awkwardness between them) and I was thinking, if only there's a way I can let them know that they're safe in front of me (it's illegal to be gay in my country) and they can act as a couple if they want to and I am queer too! But of course, I can't just approach strangers and be like hey yall queer? Cool me too anyway it's safe to be youraelf around me! Or maybe you can't but im quite shy and generally a scaredy person. 


Anyway I nternally debated with myself whether to say something to them or approach them, but I was too shy, and of course, there's a chance I could be totally wrong. What if they're just besr buds lol. 


Anyway, I only said, hey, you guys can come here and pet this cat (which I have been petting throughout the evening, this cat seems to be one of the friendliest and one of the most fluffy too! I wanted to offer to take their pic together, but I chickened out. 


Anyway, I decided that the most supportive thing I can do is to probaby just leave, give em a bit of probably much needed alone time. However, as I was leaving, one of them said ""Hey, Ms!  take care!"" And I was so shocked and I just said thanks, you too! And I can't help but wonder if they knew I knew. 


Of course, I could be totally wrong and they're just being kind because of that small interraction about the cat. But I think they knew. Or maybe im just looking into things too much because im starved for social connections haha. 


But yeah anyway, this is such a long post for something so trivial, sorry I wasted a few precious minutes of your life to read this and have a good day/night :)",oddly-,1640877856

But back in high school I tried to start drinking exclusively water to lose weight, and eventually it became a habit to drink water almost exclusively. I've had less than I normally would ever since I've stayed home during the pandemic, but pre-pandemic I estimated I was drinking 8 cups a day, I was just really thirsty I guess. I had this big 32 oz water bottle and I'd refill it when it got to about 1/4 full about 2-3 times a day.

So whenever people, namely doctors ask how much water I drink, they tend not to believe me at first. I remember a couple years ago a couple months before the pandemic I went to the hospital because I passed out while at the urgent care I was at for some constipation issues. While I was there the nurse asked me how much water I drink and I said 8 cups, and she smirked and said ""Okay but how much do you *really* drink?"", at which point my mom backed me up saying I really did drink that much.

I don't know how I would define my generation at the time..... maybe some keywords would be internet, TRL, kind of a troublemaker spirit? style wise guys wore baggy clothes and spikey hair and girls wanted to be ultra tan with pin straight hair and hoop earrings the bigger the better. food wise, we ate a lot of weird garbage (see: Lunchables tacos) because our parents couldn't care less.

fast forward many years later and there is this concept of ""millennials""--- a name for my age group. stereotypically, it's all about looking alternative.... orange, blue or pink hair, bangs cut halfway down the forehead, caterpillar eyebrows the bigger the better, alternative piercings and tats for all, and super alt ideas about food like veganism, gluten free, etc.

who are these people? I've been detached from ""my people"" for about 15 years now but..... did my people turn into that? how is that possible? and why? is that a natural evolution? there is nothing in me that sparked an evolution from the original millennial to the Neo millennial.

I was sitting at the school's dining hall with a group of friends and they were eating waffles on a shared plate. They left after a while but forgot to put their trays away, so the empty waffle plates just with a little bit of chocolate sauce and their forks and knives were still on the table. My girlfriend came to the table as they were leaving and we were sitting on the other end of the table, when a completely random girl came to the table, sat in front of the waffle plated and started EATING THE SAUCE as if it was her plate. We looked at each other a few times while she was doing it and she had no shame whatsoever while doing that. I don't think she was pretending it was her plate either, she seemed aware that we know where those plates came from. She finished the plate clean and left. 

Now I have seen her before and have heard that she has anorexia (she is visibly extremely underweight, so it makes sense), so I thought it might be related to it or may be a completely separate eating disorder.

I work in a bookstore. Just started working here a few weeks ago actually. I've heard that shoplifting is common here, however today was my first taste of it. I've witnessed shoplifters before at my other job, but we always had security guards to tackle them. Here, we do not. We aren't allowed to chase the person or accuse them in any way. However, we do sell several high priced items that makes us a large target.

I did everything I could. Customer serviced the guy, offered to hold his items in the front so he could shop, had all cams trained on him. We had three employees following him. He knew we were watching. He just didn't seem to care. When the time comes, he goes to the bathroom....or so we thought. Instead, he completely bolted through the fire exit, setting off all the alarms.

3293,CasualConversation,I am feeling so damn lucky,"I don’t mean to brag but I feel like I have such a limited space to acknowledge my accomplishments. I’m very happy with what I’ve achieved so far in my life. 

I’m under 25 and I came from a household where my parents were in government housing and they didn’t earn much. My father was a cheater, my mum tried to make things meet the budget. I grew up in a very broken and difficult household. I lived through my dad cheating on my mum and her trying to keep family for many years. 

At under 25 me and my partner have bought a house in a city that is considered to be the 3rd or 4th most unaffordable city in the world (depending what statistic you want to look at). This was with zero parental help (as much as people try discredit it by saying you would have had rich parents). I earn more than what most people earn at 40 or 50 in my city. And so does my partner. 

I feel like I’ve hit the jackpot with him because he’s the most loving, understanding, on my level, and chilled out person. And I’m so stocked to call him my partner. And I also feel so lucky because my childhood did not teach me how the be wary of men or how to expect the worst. It’s taught me how to sift them out until I find a good one. We have the most supportive, loving relationship with zero bullshit and open and honest communication.

And now with this new production which could be a year of work, I might get stuck doing the same thing again, I know I need money and it's good money, but I have no life outside what I'm doing and I'll be honest, I'm starting to feel really lonely and defeated

3298,CasualConversation,"Do you ever randomly want to talk to a stranger but can’t because of the circumstances, and then wonder what would have happened otherwise?","I’m keeping myself anonymous of course, but I was at a cinema with some people today and they were scanning the tickets that we bought, and then there was an employee who just looked a bit shy and asked a coworker “Wait, so is this how you scan them?” So I knew they were a new worker or something.

But sometimes when I see someone like that I’ll just notice little things about their temperament or something and I feel like even from one glimpse at a person you can get an impression of them by all sorts of subtle things. And I just really liked the fact that she didn’t know how to scan them and asked, and the way she asked and so on. Very weird huh.

I guess I just like it when I see people being human and failing or being awkward or not fitting in. It’s not that I want them to fail it’s just that I really like seeing people acting imperfect because that’s actually how we are even though so many people force themselves to be “perfect” and I don’t really get it. And every time I notice those little moments, I just really like it. So I gave her a big smile and said thank you and went on my way.

I didn’t necessarily feel any huge desire to go talk to this person after this. It was just one of those tiny little moments that left an impression on me and I just can’t help but think in the back of my mind - “What is this person really like? How would it be to just sit and have a conversation with them?” Now of course I’ll just forget about this and go continue living my life. I’ve had moments like this before. But that curiosity is always there, about wondering who that person is, and everything that went into their life, leading up to the moment where they got hired at a cinema and forgot how to scan a ticket on their first day lol. 

We pass so many random people every day, sometimes not even getting a chance to say hi or talk due to circumstances, and we just never see those people again. And to think that the entire course of our life could be impacted by talking to any one of them - what a strange world we live in.",unknownhuman25,1640846421

Right now I work for minimum wage at a job I actually really enjoy in a city I’m rather indifferent towards and I’m basically living cheque-cheque. I really want to attend post-secondary but I haven’t decided what I want to take. 

Recently, I received a job offer at a very remote (but beautiful!) location that pays minimum wage with full benefits, and I live in my own basement suite for free. Not paying any rent or utilities would allow me to save money fast! I’m fairly familiar with the area and know a few local folks.

3317,CasualConversation,I did a nice thing for someone and I haven't felt this happy in a long time.,"I was out shopping for wine glasses today and the saleslady who was manning the area came over and helped me choose. She was really friendly. I know it's her job but something about her told me she was being a genuine person. We talked for a while and she gave me suggestions on what to pick. I couldn't really make up my mind so I was glad she was there to assist me. 

Anyway, after she packed my glasses, she asked if I was going to give it as a gift to someone and I replied jokingly, ""No, this is a gift for myself hahaha!"" And she went, ""Aww, that sounds really nice."" I was about to walk to the cashier when I turned around and asked her again which glasses can be sold per piece because everything else was sold in pairs or in 6s. I didn't tell her that I was gonna get that wine glass for her. Again, she helped me and she said she'd even get me a box for it. I told her there was no need and I'll just pay for everything as it is. I then asked the cashier to pack the single glass in a separate paper bag. I walked back to the saleslady and handed the bag to her. I said, ""This is for you. Happy New Year!"" She seemed surprised and she didn't want to accept it, saying there was no need to get her anything but I insisted. Her coworker saw us and he said she's not supposed to accept gifts from customers. I asked what we could do because I really wanted to give it to her. Her coworker said we could go outside and pretend I handed it to her. I said 'okay, let's do that then'. On our way out, we saw her boss. I talked to her and explained the situation. I said, ""She was really helpful and I appreciate what she did for me."" Her boss was really kind about it and she was very happy for her employee saying she did a good job. The boss asked me to write my name and contact number on the paper bag in case security asks her where it was from. So I wrote down my details and before I left, the saleslady hugged me and said thank you. 

I've been feeling sad and heartbroken for a while so it was nice to feel good after a long time. It was just a small wine glass but seeing that girl happy and her eyes lit up when I gave her the bag really made my day.",harlemoverpass,1640841069

The fact that there’s groups of people who are super into them, dedicate hours of their free time to, is inspiring.

3330,CasualConversation,Just some late night dumping,"My family moved to America when I was 12 years old. I didn't know that I was moving to America until I started attending an American school. Why did my parents not tell me until then? because my dad became a criminal. He had a farm that was doing extremely well, and he decided to grow the business. Unfortunately, it rained too much for 2 years and all his crops rotted. Which means no profit and no money for the investors. Before dad could do anything, they sued him. Thankfully for my family, we happened to be in Canada for my cousin's wedding and they decided to sue him. One of the investors decided to let my dad know, and told us to just stay in the states and we did ever since. 

While in America, we sold our house back in our home country, and we were able to pay most debts. But not all. so now we have to pay about $300K. We used some of the money we got from selling the house, we started a small business in America, legally btw. Well, sorta. Since my dad is a criminal in our home country, his passport cannot be renewed. so he can't renew his license and whatnot but his visa is somehow coming out so that's good I guess. 

Anyway, we have been here for 10 years now and I'm now 22, and our business is going OK. It could be better than OK and we were actually hoping to be able to pay back to people my dad owes money to. Then covid-19 happened. lmao. Oh, we were also scammed in 2018 haha. It's ok. Kinda thanking covid-19 because with this major event, every other bad things that happened doesn't sound as bad! Like how my student visa is still not been out for 16 months now. 

My life definitely fell into a shithole after we ""fleed"" to America. Seriously, I thought I will just own a cafe and enjoy my life, never needing to work in the future when I was in my home country. But now I am a college student, who applied to graduate school for Ph.D. and a few internships to just lengthen my stay in this country. Now some might wonder why I must stay in this country. I can't reenter America unless I get a green card. This is because we changed our status (Tourist to different visa) in this country. So if I leave the country, I can't reenter and can't see my family. 

I genuinely thought of marrying my friend or random dude for a green card. I don't even know if I'll get into graduate school. I don't know if I'll get an internship. Like what do I do if nothing works out?  And I can't tell ANY OF THIS TO ANYONE INCLUDING MY PARENTS!! They will be very upset that they gave me this life and I don't want them to feel that way. They are amazing parents and the hardest workers. I am proud to call my parents my parents and I do love them a lot and don't want to hurt their feelings by telling them my issues.

If you put up the flag, the mailperson will even take your letters away for you without visiting the community box or the post office! I thought it was a Hollywood film thing, like in Benchwarmers where they go out and bat the mailboxes. I've been to NYC and Philadelphia and never saw mailboxes at the end of lots.

In urban Canada, the mailperson delivers to a rectangular box beside the door. Older homes may even still have mail slots in the door. If it's an apartment, they have a Master Key to open the multi-unit boxes and put the mail in where it needs to go. Some suburbs and rural areas have community boxes similar to the apartment multi-unit boxes, but outside with a delivery slot for mail to be picked up. The mailperson will only take Return to Sender mail from mailboxes. I think Canadians can't have them at the end of lots because of the snowplow. Does that mean then that Maine also does not have end-of-lot mailboxes?

In the U.K., apparently there are mailboxes with slots and a lock system. This is similar to Canadian boxes, but ours are not locked and it's a big pocket rather than a narrow slot.

I'm kind just in a depression block right now and am struggling with most things in life. 

My mother drilled the whiteboard to my wall, above my bed. I wasn't very happy about this, but whatever, it's worth a short. So, I started writing short-form notes to remind myself of things. 

I'm in high school, and for my law class we have a mock trial to act-out. We were given selective information on the case and witness testimonies, and one thing we know is that the accused was carrying a knife the night of the murder. So, I wrote down ""remember knife for cross exam"" on my whiteboard, then promptly forgot about it. 

The next day, my mother came to me and looked extremely concerned, and said very seriously ""\[name\] you can't bring a knife to school, that's not allowed! That's dangerous!"" 

For a hot second, I had no idea what she was talking about. And then she mentioned that she saw my reminder to ""bring a knife to school"" on my whiteboard and (1) why were you in my room when you know you're not allowed in there and (2) that is literally the dumbest and funniest interpretation ever and now I almost want to bring a knife just to spite you. 

Like, she was genuinely concerned. I had a good laugh.",random-shit-writing,1640832573

Be it a private citizen or a library, pubic or not, but we live in an age in which the information is taken for garanted, an we think we can always retrieve a piece of media, or if you prefer an information of any kind. 

But my experience on the internet, and beyond, is quite different. Expired links, lost pages, lost books, damaged informations all over the place. Just now, i noticed a couple of books outside, rady to be destroyed in the reciclation process. Those were surprisingly interesting, although some of them are completely out of my usual field of interest and so on. One of them is a collection of papers about Caravaggio, with a personal note from the author itself to the one who was gifted it, a simple note but still...others were catalogue of different artists. But the list goes on, and it includes quite interesting documents, even an history book which is falling apart, but i can restore it. I would love to address them all, but i cannot in this space. 

The fact, i know the people who decided to dispose of those books, and they are some of the nicest persons i ever met. I am genuinelly saying this, no malice was behind it, and it is partly my fault for not letting them know that i could be interested in books they would otherwise have to throw away. They had to free the house they are selling, so they had no alternative in the time, i guess. But, if you have the chance, always, always make sure those volumes won't go to waste. This is not meant to be an accusation, as i have stated they might have had to dispose of those items. If you can avoid that, you will make somebody else happy just as i am now for having saved those volumes. This is, indeed, an invitation.

I think that is due to my own personal experience, because I have had students literally ignore me when I say hello, or are rather hostile when I greet them. I honestly don't know why it is like this. If I saw an old man walking past me on the street, I would have no problem saying hello, but if it was a 22-year-old.... I would just walk past them probably and not say a word. I think it's always been like this for most of my life, but it's only recently I acknowledge this behavior.

3391,CasualConversation,Ugly situation with food delivery,"So, first of all I am always polite to restaurant staff and literally any worker out there because I also work with people and I get it. Also, I never complain to waiters and waitresses about my meal even if I find hair in it. I won’t eat and I’ll pay. I’m not THAT kind of person if you know what I mean. This is the first time that something like this happened. 

Now the story, my family and I ordered food thru food delivery app from restaurant. On the app it said that the delivery would take 35-70 minutes.

Side note, my little brother is diabetic, type 1 so he needs to eat at certain times of the day and we timed the delivery with that. After 70 minutes we started worrying because we relied on the delivery and didn’t make food just in case for him because like I said we relied on delivery. And he need to eat at this point. I called up the place with mobile phone number that was on the app and no response. Contacted the app so they also call them, again no response. We got angry and made food for him but I couldn’t let it go so I searched internet and found another land phone number half hour later. 

A woman picked up. Asked her what is happening so she said that delivery man will go now. I said I do not want the delivery anymore, thank you good bye and she started being really rude. Like the tone of her voice changed and we started arguing because she was saying that the time on the app is not accurate because they have their own deliverers and that I should have called them to ask. I started yelling that I called and the app called so no need to start being rude with me because it is not my fault. We argued for about 5 minutes while my family listened and couldn’t believe what she was saying. She asked so who is gonna pay for that food and I said not me. After few minutes she said thank you and hung up on me. 

The thing is it is not okay to leave people waiting for food that much without you knowing and agreeing with it. I would not agree with that service if I had known ( the restaurant knew because waitress on the phone said that they have a lot of people in rn) and they wouldn’t have to make food that no one wants to pay for. If I didn’t call them they would probably deliver the food 2 hours late. So I honestly do not feel bad one bit for the way that it went down, we were screaming at each other at one point which is disgusting that worker acts like that. I totally agree that customer is not always right because I deal with that sh*t nearly every day but I declined and she started to be condesending and rude, for what you will get me being angry and responding rude and yelling. I mean I am sorry that I yelled at her but I felt like I didn’t have any other choice. Never had experience like this so I was quite shook by it. Even when my food is late in a restaurant and waiters apologise I repeat 100 times that it is fine bc I do not want them to feel bad. I’m just disapointed in the whole situation.

3403,CasualConversation,How common is knowing who Matt Damon is?,"Just wondering how odd you would find it if someone in their 20s in a major US city who claims to regularly watch movies didn't know who Matt Damon is or recognize any of his movies? 

Recently at a Christmas dinner my boyfriend and I met a someone's boyfriend who had no clue who Matt Damon was. We were talking about Spirit and were like ""oh yeah with Matt Damon"" and this guy (super nice!) had no idea who we were talking about. We then went through a bunch of his movies and he hadn't just not seen them but had also not heard of them either.

It seems pretty reasonable to not know who an actor is of course, but the more we talked about it later we were surprised at how many movies Matt Damon really has been in and wanted to know what others were thinking. Any thoughts? 

Here's a few lists of movies with Matt Damon in case you were wondering about how varied and popular his filmography is.

truthfully there has been peace not having to bother about anyone for weeks before i got a new line, i do most of the calls and texts. you know now it feels when you care about friends and you reach out and suddenly it feels weird cause they act like they don't care. lol 

few weeks ago i decided to call and check up on them and obviously they're fine and all and recently it's like they ghosting on me.  i mean for about a week I've not been able to reach out to friends and all.

i feel so lonely, weird. movies, games and TV bore me as hell. the connection with device and social media is off. getting out to meet new ones is probably not possible cause it gives more stress having to go on with a convo. and where i'm from it's hard for ladies to keep conversations.

That's usually fine by the time I'm crossing at 6pm; but today I was there at 1pm and it was much busier, which I'm clearly not used to. The light box that you press was broken for a while so I'm used to not relying on that, and from where you cross as a pedestrian you can't actually see the traffic lights. The lane closest to me stopped so I started crossing, the middle lane didn't move, but the lane furthest from me was in full traffic flow and I don't know how I didn't get hit. I still feel quite shaken, lucky to be safe, and really guilty in case the driver was shaken too. The car involved seemed fine, but horns were pipping. I think it's because traffic was full flow then stopped in rush hour. I'm not used to seeing the road that busy - because I walk, morning and evening traffic is usually gone by the time I'm there. Nobody flagged me down or indicated I should stay, and I was on the street for a little while after (still walking, no headphones on during any of this) so I wouldn't have been hard to find.

I'm a 25-year-old frustrated interior design graduate. I've tried being a freelancer in ID since I can't land a job but it didn't end well because I did not get paid for what I have designed. Partly my fault for not being vocal. I basically gave them free design I've worked on for weeks/months. It got me really frustrated and depressed because I thought that getting a ""client"" would be a good sign but I was wrong. 

Luckily my brother just started his own construction firm just before covid hits so I still get to do some work mostly not directly related to ID but with other parts of construction and that's okay because it's still a part of learning. I was assigned editing some minor changes on plumbing plans, parking lot space, sewage treatment plans, etc. To be honest, I hated it and I only did it because my brother needs help, I felt so lost and still am because what I had planned or envisioned with my career isn't what's happening now. I deactivated my social media account as I don't want to see myself comparing with others' achievements, detached myself from others as I don't want to get greeted with ""How are you doing? How's work? How's life?"" as I feel like I'll be compared with my siblings and friends, but by the time I decided to get active I felt so disconnected with some of my friends like there are so many things to catch up that  I can no longer relate. Right now, I only talk to selected friends where I can somehow relate and connect. These things I just typed are scattered thoughts I can't fully express but need to get out of my chest.

3475,CasualConversation,Have you ever been the toxic person in a relationship/friendship?,"I always see posts about people cutting out toxic people from their lives but rarely about overcoming their own toxic behaviours. Of course, not many would put that information out about themselves.

Admitting you were the asshole in a situation is hard. Especially if you have only realised it in hindsight.

I have been the toxic person in my romantic relationships. In the moment, I have been able to rationalise poor choices where I fully convince myself I’m not in the wrong. When I felt most content, I would feel like something bad is coming, my own self sabotage. Picking fights, being stubborn, being inconsiderate. I never felt like I was doing any of these things intentionally, which was one of the ways I convinced myself I wasn’t doing anything wrong.

It became a vicious cycle for a long time until I eventually broke up with them because deep down I knew I was fucking up. My partner at the time wouldn’t want to break up, until months later the rose coloured glasses came off and they hated me. I think I wanted someone to love me even if I pushed them away, which is ridiculously flawed and cruel.

I’m in therapy now, have been for a year. Going through my behaviour and my family history made me understand why I did these things more. But it still baffles me that I’m even capable of being so horrible to someone I care for, for the sake of my own ego. I don’t want to be like that. I want to be kind.

I still feed off some drama but its only ever with my hurting myself now and I want to stop. For example, slept with a guy twice, didn’t really like him but then he ghosted me. I messaged him asking if he wanted to meet up and he declined. Which made me feel really drawn to him and really sad. I don’t want to continue this cycle of hurting myself or other people. 

I fully believe in myself with my friends, I deeply care for them and my actions show that. My toxic tendencies mainly just appear in romantic relationships and with my family.

Have you overcome any of your toxic behaviour, still working on it or perhaps just haven’t admitted it to yourself?

Any advice on bettering yourself?

But I live pretty far from him and I know if he's in town, I know pretty much everyone and it is normal for us to all kick it together.

3487,CasualConversation,"I failed to be a helping brother, how I could be a good dad?"," As much as I depend on my logical thinking than feelings, yet when it comes to wanting kids I only see one possible scenario that involves pain and suffering ""what if.."" for the kids and me. Pessimistic mindset is strong with this one.

Up till summer of 2014 when I was 24yo, I hoped that I would have two kids by 32. Now 31(m) no kids (still want to get married though). In that summer (when I go back from college) we discovered that my sister (29yo now) has a learning disability after she failed her 3rd semester in college. This made sense for why she struggled socially in communication and not bonding well with the family, along with anger issues, mood swings. Sometimes she acts like a 10yo and sometimes acts her age and she's aware that she has a learning disability but she only thinks it's related to studying, so do my parents.

She dropped from two colleges in the US and went back home and enrolled in an online college to avoid interaction with people since she had a bad experience with her roommates in her 2nd year due to lacking social skills. She graduated two years ago and struggling to find a job that suites her case because she doesn't want something that involves interaction with people and at the same time she would like it too. She can take care of herself, cook, order stuff, recently she learned driving and started going out by herself as long as there's another adult living with her and give her money.

Seeing my parents fail to deal with this issue over the years (when I see them inthe summer), my mom 62yo living in constant worries ""what's gonna happen to her after we are gone? ... if only she get a job I will be relieved"". Me seeing my sister in pain and can't comprehend why her life is not like the rest of people over the years, sensing my mom's worries when she randomly brings my sister's situation made me not want to be in her shoes at that age where she should be relaxing. I decided not to have kids to avoid seeing them suffer while I'm helpless which would cause me to suffer too. I failed to be a helping brother, how I could be a good dad?

Not to mention that over the years the sad stories related to kids that I heard like the Boston mom who committed suicide by driving into a lake along with her down syndrome 20yo boy because she couldn't take it anymore and was afraid of what's going to happen to him made my stand stronger. I can say that I'm not ready financially to make a family, but I know that's just a cover excuse for the real reason (I also going to take care of my sister financially after my parents). My other sister recently got married and already thinking of kids names and I'm like ""why I'm affected by sister case but it didn't affect her""

While good stories have no to so little effect to change my mind. Although my reason for wanting to have kids is for the social life aspect of it when I'm in my 50+, like the family gathering with grandparents. Even though this is one possible scenario that might not happen too for different reasons.",zeldrisgw,1640762980

3504,CasualConversation,Absolutely enraged about contact lens application! Need help!,"Hello Reddit,

I have never been more enraged in my life. I have practiced touching my eye and applying my soft contact lens to my eye to no avail. I am comfortable touching my eye with little/no flinching; however, I find that my lens simply does not want to adhere to my eye, but instead sticks to my finger. I have followed the advice of having my finger dry so that the lens sticks to the eye; however, the lens still wants to stick to my finger rather than the eye. The adhesion between my lens and my finger is so great that I can shake my finger and hand and the lens stays fixed on the finger without falling off. How am I supposed to apply my contact lens if the lens literally sticks to my finger rather than the eye, to begin with? I have watched numerous youtube tutorials and have read other Reddit posts offering recommendations to no avail. Because I find applying directly on the brown part of the eye to be quite sensitive and painful, I have gone with the technique of trying to apply to the white part of the eye before looking and blinking to get the contact lens to fall in place. This method has been shown as working perfectly in youtube tutorials, but I feel my lens does not hold its shape as well as others shown in the video. My lens is more gelatinous and deforms itself more when on my finger being applied than I feel the lens should, especially when watching tutorials where the lens stays perfectly in its circular shape through the application process. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue I have noticed is that my eye stings when the contact lens touches my eye. Though I do not care about this (Heck, I just want to get the lens on), I have been told that this is not normal and should not occur. I have assumed that the stinging and red eyes are just a normal part of getting used to the contact and saline solution, but it hasn't gotten any better the past two weeks of constant attempts at getting my lenses in the eye. What could be the cause of this stinging?

Now, unbelievably, I am finding myself running out of time to become proficient at putting my lenses on. I have college classes starting up on the 3rd and contact lenses will be essential for me to be able to focus without constant headaches caused by Anisometropia (which reduced my ability to focus the previous semester). 

&amp;#x200B;

Please Help! Thank you!

My dad isn’t into pretty much anything that is typically seen as “womanly.” Not because he thinks it isn’t manly, he’s just not into it. My mom however is very into crafting, cooking, clothes, all that sort of stuff. When my dad buys Christmas or birthday gifts for her, he puts a lot of thought into it despite not being into it himself.

He came and showed me three sweaters he got her for Christmas about a week ahead of time. He laid them out, and was nervously saying things like “I know she likes blue, they only had this one blue sweater but I think it’s nice, right? It has this cool thumb hole thingy, I hope she likes that.” And just really nitpicking every aspect, analyzing whether or not she would like it. I could tell that he probably spent hours in that store, poring over the different options to find the best possible ones for my mom. (She loved them.)

Or seeing guys buying gifts for their girlfriends. You could get the most macho man all nervous in a jewellery shop because he can’t decide whether or not his girlfriend would like a circular or oval necklace better.

3516,CasualConversation,My Revelation About Friendships and why its OK for them to end.,"I (M 17) was looking back at a friendship I used to have with someone very close to me. Her (F 17) and I had a really strong friendship that crumbled in a very dramatic and to be honest, heartbreaking fashion. It's a natural part of life to lose friends, but I'd say this one hurt a lot more than others. And for months, I spent a lot of my time lamenting what once was, what could've been (non - romantic), and what I could've done to preserve things.

But today, I had an epiphany, in some way, maybe it was meant to be that my former friend and I no longer communicate, regardless of how close we once were. For context, there was no toxicity or anything like that, for some reason, we just drifted apart. 

Regardless, if someone that I genuinely believed would be my friend long after graduating high school, is now just somebody I used to know, then maybe our friendship was never truly built to last. And while I've accepted things as they are for quite some time, it was this realization that gave one last dose of closure.

In the long run, it would've been pointless to try and preserve things. Because ultimately, we could say one way or another, the ship was gonna come crashing down. And again, there was no toxicity, or anything drastic, we just slowly stopped talking to one another. So, while my old friend and I are strangers to each other these days, at least there's some good, untainted memories and some newfound perspective.

Long story short, it's ok to let friendships end on their own, sometimes people just drift apart with no solid explanation, so there's little point in tearing yourself apart to preserve things. I get that relationships of any kind take some type of work, but ultimately, if keeping a friendship alive makes you more miserable than it does happy, than perhaps it's best to just let go.",CaptainCapp-n,1640749240
3517,CasualConversation,"Two years ago, I gave up trying to be someone else. Now I’m happier than ever.","Two years ago, I had a list of everything I was trying to convince myself to be. I was a minimalistic girl who loved pure colors like blue and white. I liked to read long novels and be as perfectly normal as possible.

I think it was the first time that I revealed my actual favorite color that I realized I was lying to myself. I was hanging out in my room with my sister when I whispered to her, “My favorite color isn’t blue. It’s pink.” 

She raised an eyebrow and said, “Okay?” She didn’t care! That was so baffling to me. I thought that pink was a childish color. A girly one. My sister’s reaction made me question why I was so scared to say that in the first place.

So I told everyone I knew the next day. Strange, I know. But the happiness I felt is something I’ll never forget.

Two years later, I am now comfortable with my identity, and I embrace everything “girly” about myself. I collect stuffed animals and play video games. I wear outfits with only pink and roll down hills when I feel like it. I’m not trying to be one thing anymore. I’m just me.

3537,CasualConversation,I'm tired of my apartment,"I'm tired for a lot of reasons. But, the most recent reason is tonight I found a rather large roach in my basement. I've lived in this place for a little over 4 years. I'm renting and the price is $900, which pre-pandemic was pricey, but now is fairly reasonable. It's a great location, but it's a pretty old place and at times feels like it's falling apart. Leaky windows/ceilings, humid/moldy basements, and pests (I've kept the best documentation that I can). While my landlord and I are pretty opposite people, we tend to get along enough. Part of me believes that's because I'm a bit of a push over. He does the bare minimum and often fluffs me off when I make requests. 

On top of that, I have this kind of superstitious belief that the reason life is getting increasingly annoying at this apartment is because what I would really like to do is quit my job and find an entry level position for a dream career in a city very far from here. The more I keep putting that life decision off, the worse the house will get, in my mind. It's also the reason I hesitate to move and sign a lease for a new apartment. In my head I've always just been a couple of months away from this decision for the last few years. 

Anyway... This post seems like it was just a ramble/venting... Not sure if anyone will even read this. I just needed to get it out, even if it was in written form on an internet thread. Hopefully this doesn't violate the rules. I've lurked this sub, but never posted.",red-bot,1640743138

3546,CasualConversation,I made my coworker think his future self was emailing him. I can't stop giggling.,"So... my coworker showed me a couple of emails addressed to himself that basically said ""Get your shit together."" He had no recollection of sending them to himself and how they came in late at night. 

I told him he probably emailed himself and got drunk or it was him from the future trying to get in touch with him. 

He has a habit of leaving his computer on overnight so I couldn't resist hopping on. I scheduled an email to arrive the evening before it was going to rain and wrote, ""Make sure not to step in any puddles tomorrow."" Something innocuous, y'know? 

I think it's been a week and we were driving to lunch. He told me the phantoms were back and showed me the email. A miscommunication earlier made me think he had caught me so I owned up to it again, ""Yup, that one was me."" ""What?! How?""

Highlights:

\-He asked how I knew it was going to rain. He was absolutely amazed it rained after the email was received. Answer: weather app forecasting rain in a few days. 

\-He was disappointed that it wasn't his future self emailing him and he was wondering why he wasn't sending stock picks back.

\-I asked if he stepped in any puddles. He told me he wasn't going to answer that. He told a couple of his coworkers about his mysterious email and they told me he had been avoiding puddles like it was the nexus point for the worst timeline. 

He's still mad but I think this was worth ruining a work relationship for. Honestly, it's mostly on him for thinking his future self was emailing him. What is this, The Lake House?",InevitableWallaby113,1640739527

There is a lockdown here and I was hoping to spend my last week of the year with a new gaming PC, that I'd been saving up for, for years. With my new job it finally felt save to get it. Bought it from a company that put it together for you (they were the only ones with parts available currently). The thing doesn't work,  spend my entire day driving to them to get it fixed. Got it back with the guy saying like ""well little lady you installed your drivers wrong!"" Absolute bullshit, guess what? Got home and after a while PC doesn't work again, its the hardware like I told them. Now I'm going to have to spend the rest of my week sending it back and hopefully getting my money back.

My older sister clicks so well with everyone and I love that she's listened to so much and loved by the rest of the family, but I really am left as the total opposite and everyone can see it. She has a respectable job and a long-term boyfriend she's integrated into the family and these are things I won't have when I'm her age in 18 months.

There were 16 of us here yesterday and I really tried but I think I was left as the person who seemed to belong least out of the whole group.

The entire neighborhood was covered in a blanket of snow, and all the usual noise was muffled, which created a solemn, satisfyingly-hushed effect. 

I saw that someone had passed by a little before I came out, because there were leftover footprints going up the path. Naturally, I stepped in the person’s footprints for a bit, and it reminded me that we’re all out here living our own rich, detailed lives, and that we’re more connected than we think.

It felt like walking in the middle of a Hallmark movie, except that I didn’t run into any eligible bachelors along the way.

This was so annoying to me because I have a bunch of close male friends who are straight and none of them ever try to get in my pants or try to pursue me. The idea that men will always fall for a female friend is false. Ok it may be common but come on platonic friends can exist. I even caught feelings for a very close male friend and he told me he only views me as a friend and yes he's straight as a board. I got over him and we still talk basically daily. Not every guy is going to fall for their female friend just cause they vibe and she's cute. I'm not even saying that my male friends aren't attracted to me and would turn down having sex with me if the chance came up. Idk maybe they would maybe they wouldn't it isn't my business. It doesn't bother me at all if my male friends are attracted to me the point is my friends don't just talk to me because it they want to have sex with me they talk to me cause their my friend and we're friends first.

3601,CasualConversation,A tragic story involving cocoa powder,"So today I go to the grocery store to get a few things. I needed cocoa powder. Cocoa powder was on the top shelf. 

Now I’m 5’0”. The top shelf of a grocery store is basically Mt Everest  to me. So like a genius I decide okay, if I just stretch I can probably edge it into my grasp. So I reach. I can’t see the shelf  very well while reaching, so I just feel for the cocoa powder canister and keep… reaching…. a little more…okay, I’ve got it! See, just because I’m petite doesn’t mean I need help all the time! 

Next moment I feel something hit my head hard. For a couple of seconds I’m dazed from the pain but then I look down and the aisle is absolutely covered in cocoa powder. My clothes are too. Turns out there was another container of cocoa powder on top of the one I blindly grabbed. Said container had been displaced, fallen right on my head, and busted open on the floor sending its contents all over the place. Some fellow customers are staring at me in disbelief and there’s a sort of chocolatey cloud in the air. 

Embarrassed, disgruntled, with my head still throbbing, I go find an employee and apologize profusely for the spilled cocoa. The employee is not at all amused by the whole business. But my family, upon hearing about the incident when I reach home, laughed for like 20 minutes.

3603,CasualConversation,My fiance just broke up with me. Need some non-personal internet friends to make me feel better.,"I was long-time close friends with R. We got together in 2019 after much hesitation on my behalf because I'm very insecure about being a good partner. He was supportive and patient and made me immensely happy. He proposed in August of this year, with a ring that is personal to my touches and a setup that was so romantic and he knew I would like. 

After his proposal, he left the country to pursue tertiary education in England. We had been preparing for it for a while and I knew long distance would be the hardest thing we might ever do. We had rough patches and highs and lows, and I had my fair share of fuckups (depression like nothing I've ever felt). 

His family invited me for a late Christmas hangout on Boxing Day. I happily accepted because I love his family and I've been trying to build my connection with them. Then my household lost access to our vehicles because the motor for the gate shut off with the cars inside, we had to borrow a shitty car with no handbrake and a permanent engine light (?????), and my family decided to visit my aunt with Alzheimers on Boxing Day morning. (My father had a similar debilitating condition and my aunt was very loyal in visiting when she was able. My family is trying to return it.) 

Boxing Day rolls around, and I went to see my aunt. She lives an hour in one direction while R's family is another hour in the opposite direction. I was a bit impatient because i wanted enough time to see them. The visit came to an end, we came back to my area to drop off another family member, then my mom needed to eat and take some painkillers for a headache. I suffer with birth-control migraines so I'm very empathetic to anyone who comes down with a headache. She ended up taking a 2-hour nap and I didn't want to wake her up. Suddenly it was too late and I called the family to reschedule and apologise. 

This was the cherry on top for R, who knows my family has toxic tendencies and poor boundaries. Things like... elder respect... passive-aggressive behaviours... blood above all else... I've been working to separate myself from it, and R is a huge motivator in this. I've read my fair share of the relationship advice and AITA subs and recognise a lot of the complaints in my own extended family. And while I've made great progress, I still fall short sometimes. R has often complained that I will sacrifice him for fam members who will never extend to me. 

Our fate was sealed 20 minutes ago after a protracted argument. He's convinced I will never change. (Personally, I think he's blowing this way out of proportion. He's quick to defend his immediate family, a trait I admire. But this was out of my hands.) This is not the first fight of this sort, concerning MY family. He's upset I didn't wake my mother up (from her HEADACHE NAP) or ask her to ask one of my other siblings to give me a drop in the shit car. (One bro is too young to drive, one doesn't do anything for me, and one is concerned about the car's roadworthiness even though it was cleared by a trusted mechanic. I would have driven myself but I'm not 25 yet so I have to have my name on the insurance.) 

I feel numb right now. I just lost my best friend. He was the source of my ambition. He is the reason I am where I am right now. He's been a steadfast rock and the funniest person I know. My confidante and hiking buddy. And now he's in another country where idk, he might find someone who won't stress him out the way I do.

3630,CasualConversation,I witnessed true freedom today and I want to live like that. Yet I can't.,"I'm currently travelling in the southern parts of Europe and today, I watched a dance troop from a remote village perform a local dance in a big city. It was true beauty. It was my life's philosophy coming to play. I experienced the true beauty of humanity. For some reason, it made me really emotional. Probably because the dancers and singers were so into the music, that they didn't care about anything else. They were enjoying life, living deliberately and were completely present in that very moment. Their smiles and gleaming eyes. They had expressions of happiness that you just cannot fake. It made me reflect on my life right now. I'm stuck in the same old rat race like everyone else. Feelings of freedom and independence are long lost in today's world. From trends to traffic, to tension, to violence and war and confusion.
We have forgotten the true essence of a wild man's dreams. We all have crazy dreams, but not everyone is crazy enough to run after those dreams. To pursue them. I watched passion and human innovation, and it deeply made me sad when I realized that the lives those troops led was something I wanted to do. To run free and live on the road. Share happiness and live, not for the sake of it, but to truly live and suck the marrow out of life. Yet here I am, stuck in one of the most competitive schools in an Asian country with parents who have been told the same great big lie from their friends and fathers. Taught to be slaves in a modern corporate world. I'm stuck in having to complete the tedious yet pointless duty of school and college. Running free and wild, like wild horses in grasslands and rivers flowing through mountains and lush green grasslands. That's where I wanted to be.
And yet,

Here is where I am.

3633,CasualConversation,I just realized that my left hand is my dominant hand,"I’m 19 years old. For the past 19 years I thought that I was right handed.. I’ve been eating, drawing, writing with my right

It all started when I joined a kickboxing gym when I was 10 years old. My left hand was sharper and faster than my right, but I still fought from an orthodox stance cuz that’s how I was taught in that gym

Then as I was growing up I found a lot of stuff that I could do better with my left than my right. For example, my left hand has always been stronger. Even when I work out at the gym my leftie feels stronger than my right

I joined another gym where I occasionally train kickboxing. Now I fight from a southpaw stance, far more comfortable for me

The thing is tho, when it comes down to writing and drawing, my right hand is the way to go. Cuz I’ve been doing it with my right my whole life

I can eat with both hands

My father has worked in transportation all his life, and is recently retired. He does not have a whole lot in terms of education, and has always been 100% involved in his work, so he does not have a lot of hobbies or the like either. Lately he has said things that indicate he needs to do something, but does not quite know what. He has expressed interest in making videos on YouTube, without having any experience in video production or editing, or engaging in animation, without ever having drawn anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I no longer live at home, and do not meet him that often, but I understand that he needs something interesting to do. The suggestions he has mentioned are not realistic for a well grown person to suddenly start with. I would have understood if he had mentioned them only as a pastime, because it can be fun to do video and animation just for fun, but he mentioned them specifically in a context of becoming ""popular"". I love my father and want the best for him, and do not want to hurt him, but I feel it would be wrong to encourage him to start something like this with the wrong starting point.

3653,CasualConversation,My bf got me one of my childhood wants for Christmas,"I’m 28. Christmas Eve night I could tell my bf was so excited to give me my gift because he kept asking if I wanted it now or later. I told him I wanted to wait until Christmas Day. He said at 12 it *would* be Christmas. Technically, yes. But I wanted to wait a little longer in the day, ya know? 

Anyway, 12 came. And he said he wanted to go ahead and give it to me. He told me as we were walking outside to go get it, “I want you to know how much I listen to you. It’s something you always wanted. Guess what it is. And really think about it first, something you always wanted.”

I really thought about it for a second, and there’s always been two things on my mind that I’ve always wanted as a kid and couldn’t afford to get. A trampoline and a four wheeler. So I asked, “a trampoline?”. His eyes lit up and he shook his head. I said, “No, you didn’t!” He just kept shaking his head as we were walking to his truck and got in to pull the box out. 

Talk about someone excited and speechless. I think that’s the most someone has ever given me for Christmas before. My twin was over for the holidays and put it up and jumped on it themselves a bit with me. It was like a present for us all.

3657,CasualConversation,The kindness of strangers,"In 2008 I travelled solo in Costa Rica. A couple of nights in I drank a lot of tequila on an empty stomach into the early hours. I was up at about 6am for a white water rafting trip combined with a tourist bus across to the other side of the country. Obviously feeling grim. 

My next mistake was chugging a lot of tap water full of exotic bugs unfamiliar to my delicate English stomach. As the day wore on I felt worse and worse. Because I was feeling crap I didn’t really speak to anyone else on the bus, and in fact decided I didn’t like any of them (they were mostly loud excitable USA college kids who were probably great, but I just wasn’t in the mood). So as the afternoon wore on I sat there in the back seat feeling sorry for myself.

By about 6pm I realised I needed to be urgently sick and had to get the bus to stop. So I tapped the shoulders of the people in front, who must have been surprised to hear me talk. What happened next was a simple but wonderful exercise in human kindness. The message was quickly relayed to the driver, who stopped at a small roadside cafe, the owner of which quickly ushered me to the bathroom. 

Walking back to the bus 5 minutes later, seeing it lit up on the dark road side with all the tourists sitting there patiently waiting, filled me with so much gratitude. They and the cafe owner hadn’t really done all that much, but they’d seen a fellow human in distress and sprung into action to efficiently and kindly get done what was necessary to sort me out. I still remember it. 

Interesting footnote: feeling crap, I stayed an extra day in the next town. On that extra day I met a German girl also travelling solo. We had a holiday romance that turned into a long distance relationship, and eventually she moved in with me in London. We then split up almost immediately but she stayed in London, met someone else there and had a kid with him. That kid wouldn’t exist if I’d just bought a bottle of water rather than drinking the tap water!",rasputinny,1640708430

3659,CasualConversation,"Moving to a new city, again. What's your story of starting over?","I am 25F and I am moving to a new city once again. This is going to be my fourth time in seven years. I also moved flats ninth times in seven years. 

I never planned this sort of life but whenever I try to stay still, life sends me on. I have no roots apart from my family home in the country where I grew up but I am sure that this is the only place where I do not want to live - although I spent here four months this year to recharge after finishing my masters. 

Now, I leave in 48 hours and instead of being recharged and confident since I should be basically a pro at moving to new places alone, I am only filled with anxiety and resentment. I am scared of what's ahead of me and the idea of knowing no one and struggling to get to know people. I always suffered from mild (social) anxiety but the pandemic just moved it to another level despite being in therapy and working a lot on my mental health. I am all familiar with these sorts of feelings before leaving for somewhere unknown for months, but they always take me aback by how intense they can become.

The older I get, the more I fear that I have no place in this world, and I am unable to put roots somewhere or create some meaningful connections. I have several very close friends but they are all around the world, none of them by my side. I've fixated lately on buying a property at some point soon to give me that base that I crave so much, but as doing the research, it seems impossible for a young person without a good financial background to do so. 

So with all those thoughts and feelings, I thought of posting here and asking - do you have any positive stories of starting over and over again? Different places, jobs, relationships? Funnily enough, I dislike beginnings and fear changes and yet I live this sort of life.",Lorakeec,1640708223

3661,CasualConversation,The best thing to invest in is you,"Sup, redditors!  
Recently I have been thinking about the most valuable thing for a human nowadays. What could it be? Freedom? Health?  Family? Or money maybe? Convinced, all of them are important. Without freedom other things have no value. Without health you also need no freedom broadly and money as well. Family is something sacral and the most valuable for most of us. We are thinking of them, taking care of them and hope they also had freedom, were healthy and rich as possible.   


  
We live contemporaneously at the most interesting and one of the most difficult times. A lot of new possibilities were shown. We are observing the crypto-boom which transforms and influences almost every life area. So what was a real revelation for me through this year.. It is the idea of DeHealth (decentralized Healthcare). Try to imagine this and you will guess that all those words I mentioned above are now included in one term. Freedom of choice. Freedom for you and your family to be healthy as well as get free and approachable  treatment. And what about money? Seems like it is worthy cause won’t demand huge expenses at all.   
try to imagine the app implemented into blockchain with an AI-Bot which can help you and consult in a minute just on the go. No queues, bribes and risks for catching a virus in clinics. No need to visit clinics without real accidents. A lot of new options will be opened with AI. And I talk about it not like a dream. It is possible now and here. But Every country has its own choice: to be successful and innovative or to be stuck in the past.

3663,CasualConversation,I'm on my path to fully accepting that I will never have a romantic relationship,"Friends I had when I was younger have all partnered up and have kids now and we no longer talk. Friends I have now are younger than me since the ones my age are all married and have kids so we don't really relate. Eventually my younger friends will partner up and start families and we'll stop talking too. That's just a normal way of things. My mom is getting old and if I'm lucky I'll still have her around for another 5 years or so. I have only had 1 girlfriend over 12 years ago and haven't had anything remotely possible of another relationship.

I have worked on myself to be an attractive partner (but not for the sole reason) since I was a teenager. I made sure to watch what I ate, make myself socially capable, having many hobbies, continue my education, getting a decent career, all of that. However, my biggest hurdle is being a gay woman. It is awfully disheartening knowing that no matter how well you get along with someone and how much you click it doesn't matter because you're immediately disqualified before you can even shoot your shot. The only women whose attention I occasionally get are from curious straight ladies. Turns out that was who my only girlfriend was. 

People try to tell me how great I am and how lucky someone would be to be with me. The problem is I can never fully explain to them so that they will understand that it doesn't matter since I'm the wrong gender. I've had a number of my straight female friends tell me that if I was a guy I would definately be a catch and they would want to be with me. I know they mean well and don't intend to hurt me but I can't help but feel worse because all I can gather from that is ""your life would be a thousand times better if only you were able to change this obviously permanent thing about yourself"". 

I go through waves of super loneliness and depression to sheer numbness about everything. I'm in the numbness phase which includes accepting being alone.

3668,CasualConversation,Festive realisations and humbug feelings.,"As the Christmas celebrations come to a close, I have come to realise that the love interest I’ve had for a long time, appears to have lost their interest in me. If there ever really was an interest, that is. 

It’s come as a somewhat ‘harsh’ reality. I had a feeling it would happen, but perhaps expected things to play out different. Combining this with the fatigue of the past year/two years/thought of the future, I feel completely lost. I’m exhausted with pretending to be happy and I’m exhausted with the daily routines that haven’t been broken up by proper holidays or ‘time outs’. 

It’s not as if things have been terrible. I have a stable job, people who care about me. Had some good times with said interest. I just feel I’m currently in a state of “now what?” 

I don’t feel particularly sad, I don’t feel angry. I don’t even feel ~disappointed. I just don’t feel anything. I have no interest in my favourite things, I can’t seem to focus. Just trying to keep busy. That said, I’ve made no attempt to do any for of socialising. I can’t bring myself to see people, even though I know that would be a great help.

My day is packed with obligations and day-to-day chores leaving a tight space for stuff that I want to do, so I have started cutting on everything that I consider secondary like replying to emails, checking message apps, even ironing or folding clothes. 

I feel like I am missing out on some things (for example being active on family/friends message groups) but it all comes down to the tradeoffs we are willing to do. 

I am more disorganized and less ""productive"" but I am able to release some time to enjoy my hobbies and interests.

3682,CasualConversation,"Maybe not super casual or fun, BUT it is conversation."," I think I found my soulmate. Online, so regardless if we will unite in the future and meet or whatever life may hold I'm pretty sure I found that person you go your entire life looking for. It's a really surreal feeling. 
I've settled for never meeting and him being with other people because I think it's the most likely possibility and its just wierdly complicated. 
Well one of my problems within this situation is that I'm jealous of the people he might be with for the rest of his life. 
 I dont experience sexual attraction like he does, and that is fine but I am a possessive person, I just like to have what's mine in a relationship and never let anyone else touch it. So being in this position where him and i are unable to be together, and it feels like it isn't time for us the thought of him experimenting and being with other people sexually kind of destroys me. The thought of him looking at someone else and getting turned on, the thought of him wanting and desiring sex with someone else makes me upset and I know that its normal and of course he's not bound to me because we have a connection and I know all of these things.
 It's like I know men tend to be more primarily physically attracted to women than women are to men. At least that's been my experience with myself, with other women and with men, and I don't judge that because I understand and I get it. I understand the attraction and the attraction with having sexual experiences with different people, but that doesn't change the fact that it hurts, every time that I think about it, every time that I think about him I just get pain and sometimes thinking about him makes me incredibly happy and content which is a contrast that destroys me. 
Its killing me, I have a beautiful family and I love myself, I have been trying to experience my life to the fullest because especially in this day and age you really dont know how long people will last you and when I'm sitting there with my family, laughing and smiling, playing and eating, chatting and joking, and the thoughts of him come into my mind it's like I'm lost in my head in this deep longing thinking about the life I'll live without him, and it feels like I'm mourning a deep love. It is intoxicating and painful. There's so much more to say, but expressing emotions is so difficult when they are so deep.
 I guess the main point of this is the pain not being able to be with someone brings because I believe being with him in a completely non sexual way would be incredibly passionate and fulfilling.

....and your other cousins got a gaming PC and upgrades to their Corvette?

It is currently really cold where I am, and there is also snow, but it is just so bright, that it reminded me of the summer.

3703,CasualConversation,I failed my driving test for the second time and I don’t know what to do,"When I took the theory test I passed right away, but when I got to the actual driving, things changed. After about 25 hours with 3 different driving instructors and about 15 privately with my sister, girlfriend and father, I took the first exam. 

It was going really smoothly until I mistook a trun and had to reverse the car. When we finished, the instructor told me “you don’t look far enough when you drive, but apart from that, I can tell you know the theory. Exam failed.”

I was fucking devastated to hear his excuse for making me pay the 100 $ “cost” of the exam without passing it, and telling me I had to wait until after christmas to book another one.

Today I took the exam again and this time the “apprentice” examiner, who was sitting in the back last time, was sitting next to me and conducting the exam. The actual examiner sat in the back and didn’t speak a word. Fast forward an hour: exam failed again, and for the same bullshit reason as last time. Only this time my stupid ass didn’t just make a wrong turn, because the street I was in was a one-way only and so I almost went against traffic.

Now I have to tell my family that I have failed again and have to wait another 3 months to try and, most likely, fail again.

3708,CasualConversation,The kindness of strangers + new life,"In 2008 I travelled solo in Costa Rica. A couple of nights in I drank a lot of tequila on an empty stomach into the early hours. I was up at about 6am for a white water rafting trip combined with a tourist bus across to the other side of the country. Obviously feeling grim. 

My next mistake was chugging a lot of tap water full of exotic bugs unfamiliar to my delicate English stomach before getting on the bus. As the day wore on I felt worse and worse. Because I was feeling crap I didn’t really speak to anyone else on the bus, and in fact decided I didn’t like any of them (they were mostly loud excitable USA college kids who were probably great, but I just wasn’t in the mood). So as the afternoon wore on I sat there in the back seat feeling sorry for myself.

By about 6pm I realised I needed to be urgently sick and had to get the bus to stop. So I tapped the shoulders of the people in front, who must have been surprised to hear me talk. What happened next was a simple but wonderful exercise in human kindness. The message was quickly relayed to the driver, who stopped at a small roadside cafe, the owner of which quickly ushered me to the bathroom. 

Walking back to the bus 5 minutes later, seeing it lit up on the dark road side with all the tourists sitting there patiently waiting, filled me with so much gratitude. They and the cafe owner hadn’t really done all that much, but they’d seen a fellow human in distress and sprung into action to efficiently and kindly get done what was necessary to sort me out. I still remember it. 

Interesting footnote: feeling crap, I stayed an extra day in the next town. On that extra day I met a German girl also travelling solo. We had a holiday romance that turned into a long distance relationship, and eventually she moved in with me in London. We then split up almost immediately but she stayed in London, met someone else there and had a kid with him. That kid wouldn’t exist if I’d just bought a bottle of water rather than drinking the tap water!",rasputinny,1640678696

I absolutely do not want to make group class awkward, or make him feel uncomfortable. I've thought about just asking him, but like I said, we're always in group class together.

Listening to music by different artists is so fun for me because they are all individuals with unique and personal tastes when making their own crafts.

3713,CasualConversation,Feeling really down and sad despite the holidays,"So for the holidays I’m back with my family, and because of this rapid COVID surge I decided to get the booster shot. I had little/to no reactions for the 1st two shots, but for some reason, the booster really kicked my ass this time around. Worse, I got on Christmas Eve, so Christmas Day I wasn’t really “there” with my family. I started to feel better yesterday, but my immune system must’ve really got affected because today I woke up with the worst cold sore I’ve ever had. Like it is clustered. 

Regardless, I spent the day sulking around the house and I get the feeling my parents and siblings were sick and tired of my complaining and moping. My family would try to make me feel better by saying, “oh it’s not that bad, it’s not the end” or “at least you’re not missing legs”. I feel bad for ruining the holiday spirit and tried to be engaging, but when your body is “off”, it’s really hard to feel like yourself and be cheerful with everyone. None of them have cold sores, so I don’t think they really get what I have to do to manage it. For those that don’t know, I have to be really careful with utensils, cups/bottles, etc. or I could spread it to others or to other parts of my body. They want to go out for lunch tomorrow and go to the mall, but I already told my mom I’m backing out. Wearing a mask for an extended amount of time with a cold sore does not sound smart, plus like I said earlier, I’m not feeling super cheery/confident. She was upset, and idk if I’m overreacting/being too sensitive, but I’m not changing my mind. 

Anyways, I just needed to get this off my chest to someone or anyone. I really appreciate this sub’s openness and understanding for people’s issues and love the community ❤️ hope everyone is having a good holidays. 

TLDR: got the booster on Xmas Eve, and it hit me hard. Dealt with vax symptoms Xmas day and the 26th, then today I get the worst cold sore, making my life more difficult. Thus, feeling down and defeated.",11Y2B,1640676434

I had this fear , years ago . It was not drastic though . I would like to address my fears through this portal I would like to send it back through days . 
   2020 summer 
(I had this venue I had to go , even though it was some sort of covid going on , this was my school fuction after all . By the way , te lived on land before . But as an ugly lion of the shore , in the right place I began to polish . ) 
The chorus began , so did the boys behind , in front of me laid this stage , but I had to wear some sort of mask , ( I knew this has been some sort of fashion in development back then , but it was for our safety ) 
The sun directly above us , and sweat I had over , the mask would drench on the sides so were my friends of the square , this was a ceremony for my next grade , i had graduated from previous one . --( this was the time , covid was not serious yet )--
End of the year 2020
The situation became something unimaginable,  the dairy pages I would write back then , and future far after . I couldn't stop to see the wind hitting me on , for there was not a window that could give me the open air , as to I could walk, could I talk with my mask not on . This was the time I and we took it seriously , and under circumastances, did I develop this fear . ( this is me talking to you from the future , talking using the previous words , deep on and depth I couldn't perceive how perfect I could be using my prediction ) 
The fear , it wasn't a mental illness , it was not anxiety but this fear had me to perceive differently,  how I could see the future of humanity,  how serious or funny reddit could be ( all in bold ) 
 
Lock downs and conspiracies,  conspiracists and activists-- what did I miss? 

I had to over come my fear of could I met my friends again , for example it was not a fear I mean it is a fear ( jokingly) I mean this was some sort of thing that grabs me form doing things like what of I die . ( and again that is fear , this is how far I had to look back then,  and it is fear ( again ?))
There were many protocols , you go outside and you'll see the streets empty as the minds of young and youth were , or may be not until we all met online on diff plat forms as reddit discord , but we still had the urge to play around physically enjoy our teen hood !? . 

But this got me again , now I had this wonderful feeling how beautiful and new 2021 could be . 
And that's how friends I am here from the future asking you for a favour , for this be a time capsule for the future and on . Type it in comments and add your favourite 2021 moments",Remarkable-Eagle947,1640674686

3729,CasualConversation,is my new years resolution good?,"from what i've seen, the community in this subreddit is very humble and kind, so i trust you guys enough to want to share this.

i stay up late every single night because i just don't want to go to sleep. it's actually almost 1am as i'm writing this lol. i hate going to bed, i want to stay up all night and murder everybody on Blade and Sorcery and make music and have fun, but obviously i can't do that because my body will just be like ""no ❤""

but, what i can do is wake up earlier to have more time to do those things, especially because i am indeed a morning person.

based on that, i think a good new years resolution for me is start going to bed between 9:30pm-10:30pm, so i can have enough sleep and then wake up early in the morning to have more time to do the things i love before work or any other important thing that will take up most of my day.

is that any good? what do you guys think?",actuallyzer0,1640669645

3734,CasualConversation,Funny High School Stories looking back.,"sup all. I graduated high school this year in june, after the shitshow of the ‘zoom year’.

but to end the year off i want to look back at some funny moments, either mine or not mine.

ill start;

in freshman year, my algebra class was doing a kahoot on god knows what, theres no way i remember. the teacher was fed up with all the fake meme names people would do, so she kicked any name not from the class.

my name is very similar to a certain very popular lebanese pornstar’s name, its only different by one letter.

when i joined the game with my full name, one quiet kid in the class just BURST out laughing yelling like “TEACHER TEACHER ITS NOT HIS REAL NAME 🤣🤣🤣” (not the exact words but the same idea). Cue my friends chewing him out (also loudly) about it being my real name. 

i had trouble keeping my sides in, especially since this dude doesnt make a sound on most days. 

(by the way, yes, the teacher was indeed very bad at keeping the class under control. IIRC she was fired for pepper spraying a student the year after but that could just be a rumor.)

I took a look at my truck and said ""I beg to differ, it has 4 new winter tires and 4 functional brakes"".

Through me behaving in this manner consistently and with integrity in every situation, I've met some of the hardest people who are very loving on the inside and they shown it to me very quickly and made some solid friends for a long time, albeit very few.... The way I am, just makes me not want to talk to anyone anymore (32m) it seems most people don't even take compliments well, the kind that are subtle and left up to the interpretation of the listener. 

I approach random people onthe street who look approachable (people who don't want to be talked to or approached, I can tell by their body language and I skip them) the ones who look approachable like they want to tlak to a stranger I talk to and tell them what I like about the few seconds I know them and I walk on, some become friends and maybe some of them just feel good afterwards and I don't know the rest. 

I'm married, I'm happy, and I have no expectations on ANYONE, Im just feeling I should be a hermit and keep my circle from my journey this far (or be more picky and less thinking-everyone-is-who-i-could be.... .

He said it in a jokey way and I laughed, but it was in that way when someone says it like a joke just to soften it a bit when they really mean it. 

Like, it just feels weird that someone would say that? Im not mad at him. Everyone makes assumptions, and maybe I’ve said things in the past that made him come to this conclusion. But it feels odd? I don’t know?

I’ve had a similar thing when I talked online once about some stuff (not seeking help it was just seeing if people related to some things regarding sleep) and someone replied “you probably have high functioning depression” and I was so taken aback.

The area that I went to is mostly visited by American tourists and locals from other parts of Mexico. I was born and raised in Los Angeles all my life, so even though I'm American, my ancestry is Mexican, so of course, I don't look stereotypically ""American"".

There were some people my age playing water polo. I didn't want to play, but my mom told me to play so I could make friends with them. There were about eight of us playing, four on one team and four on the other. Four of them were from another part of the US, and they had all come together on the trip as family friends. The other people were locals. One of the guys (19M) started making passive aggressive comments about how we were losing, and I forget what he said, but it was clear that he was talking about me. I kept looking at him, because I was hoping he'd get the the hint that I understood. He avoided eye contact, probably because he knew he was being a jerk.

At one point, the ball hit me in the face, and knocked my sunglasses off. One of the people on my team told me in Spanish where my glasses fell. I was shocked and embarrassed, and I didn't even register that she spoke to me in Spanish. I asked super loudly ""what did you say?""

After that, the guy who was talking about me started teaching me how to throw the ball. If I succeeded at throwing it, he'd congratulate me. And if I missed, he'd tell me ""good try"" or progress"". He was smiling and everything. I think he probably felt bad because he was saying all this stuff about me not knowing that I understood him. We actually became good friends later on

So suppose you were born and grew up in a small coastal city, and you know a lot of people there.

You work remotely and you can move wherever you want inside the country, but you also have a preference for this two cities. Consider that you have no family, so absolutely no support, only you, your salary and savings (eq. to 30 months of expenses).

3774,CasualConversation,We've had the christmas from hell so far but I'm still happy because I know we're gonna look back and laugh at this in years to come,"So on the 23rd my SO and I got a last minute invite for a booster shot and we jumped at the chance to get it. Then I had a severe immune response. Flu symptoms, fever, aches all over, nausea, inability to move basically all Christmas eve. That eased a little on Christmas Day but I was still getting hot and cold flashes and was exhausted so only managed to cook a ham and microwave some mashed potatoes for us (my SO can't cook for his life). 

Throughout all of this I was getting back pain from the injection site and from lying down so much. This moved into my shoulders which then caused me to have a severe cluster migraine last night and I had no painkillers left to treat it. Just blinding pain. Only got 3 hours sleep. 

So then my SO was scheduled to have some very minor elective surgery today. He went and got it done and then afterwards was walking back to the car through a mall, slipped and fell on some wet tiles and broke his elbow. 

He had to go to the hospital and obviously couldn't drive so I had to uber for him. But before this, the dressing on his surgery wound had to be treated and was bleeding profusely. This happened while I was out trying to get him his prescriptions he called me in a panic saying he thinks he needs to go to the emergency room for it too. Keep in mind he had been trying to change the dressing with one hand. So he was totally panicked. I've had surgery before and I knew bleeding was normal so I just said ""call the surgeon right now and tell him"" and he says okay and hangs up. Meanwhile I'm trying to get these prescriptions and also a bunch of additional gauze for him.

I run back home with it to find that he's basically having a nervous breakdown over it so I hold his hand and do a breathing exercise with him. I tell him I'll change the dressing for him. I have never seen so much blood in my whole life. I changed the dressing and told him to finish it because I had to go and lie down, knowing I was about to faint but trying to keep him calm. 

The new dressing worked anyway and he got to the hospital and was treated in an hour. He has to wear a sling and now I'm going to have to help him with everything related to the other surgery for the next 6 weeks. 

What a fucking christmas. 

Anyway, I'm proud of myself for keeping a cool head and I'm not too bummed about this because I know that we will genuinely be in hysterics telling this story to friends in a few christmases to come. I know because when I was 6 my whole family caught the flu one christmas right after we'd moved into a new (but very old) house. That was bloody miserable but we laugh about it now.

we decided to run back to the store. i also decided to leave my phone at the apartment. my friend drove me back to the thrift store. asked the cashier if anyone turned in a wallet. nope. 


i checked my phone when we got back to the apartment to double check. i had seven missed calls and texts from my mom.


turned out, some woman in the parking lot saw the wallet fly off the roof of the car. all my stuff was everywhere in the street. this nice lady gathered up most of my things and managed to find me by paying $2 for some website to find my phone number. the phone number that came up was my mom’s. 


she got me through to that lady. when i went to pick it up she said “don’t worry, i didn’t tell your mom what was in your wallet.” i thought that was weird to say but i thanked her many times and we went on our ways. 


i checked to make sure everything was in there. and then saw what she was referring to. i had ibuprofen stored in a ziploc bag in there. i guess it got ran over because it looked like fine white powder. i couldn’t stop laughing.

I remember my dad telling me to lie to my mom about something (can't remember what exactly) and even though my mom is nuts I still felt confused. He wanted me to lie because the truth would have made her mad.  So anyway I lied and then after that I started lying about all kinds of things because I guess I didn't understand why lying about certain things is okay but lying about other things  isn't okay.  So I would make up stories about my day in school and I remember one day my dad asked me about one of these lies (again can't really remember the details specifically) and then when I revealed I had been lying he got mad. 

Not sure why this whole thing popped into my head. But anyway that's my anecdote for the evening.",GorillaS0up,1640647314

3.) I don't really feel like anyone in the group is overly eager to talk w me about things.

3793,CasualConversation,I somewhat enjoyed lockdown,"
For the past 14 years I’ve been a very social person. Going to parties, events, lunch and dinners, hangs, dates, outings etc. Literally there was a 5 year period where I was going out pretty much every night if I could. 

I just really enjoy going out, and I unfortunately suffer from “fomo” if I miss something.

Lockdown finally gave me permission to just stay inside for a long period of time. I replayed old video games, got into multiplayers games with old childhood friends, read so many books, watched movies I had been meaning to see, got into plants, a routine work out schedule, lost 10 pounds, worked on some new paintings, got really into understanding myself and being introspective, worked on a bunch of projects I had been putting off. I felt like lockdown made me grow up in a sense. 

When the world somewhat opened up again, I finally had a healthy balance with going out and I felt so much more well rounded.

I was recently talking to my friends about this, and they said I was crazy for finding any kind of enjoyment in this. I don’t know. Made me realize I really appreciate quiet solitude just as much as chaotic party environments.",here_to_stay669,1640642736

3795,CasualConversation,"Three months ago, I quit a high paying job for an easier one. I was told I was making a grave mistake. I am now making about the same without all the stress.","I was working in the aerospace industry, where OT was mandatory. Each pay period is 80 hours plus 32 hours of OT. That’s two extra hours Monday through Friday, plus six hours on Saturday. 

Basically, I was out of the house before sunrise and be home by sunset. Throw in some SoCal traffic, I was on a work sleep schedule for 2 years before I called it quits. 
 
When I gave my two week notice, my brother (who convinced me to get the job in the first place) said I was making a huge mistake. That I would be bringing home a lot less, and that this job is a once in a life time thing, and that other people would kill to be me. 

But I was too burned out to keep going. Also, the fact I was getting paid 15 dollars an hour didn’t help his argument.  

Flash forward to today, where my new boss sat me down and told me he was substantially increasing my pay. And on top of that, gave me a substantial bonus that would keep coming if I stayed with the company. 

I am now making pretty much the same, plus better benefits and a 401k option. Not only that, but I regained those 32 hours from not working OT.

Prog metal/rock is pretty much all I listen to.

Haken formed in London, England in 2007. Their debut album *Aquarius* was released in 2010 and they've released 5 albums &amp; an EP since then. Their most recent album, *Virus*, was released last year (Title has nothing to do with COVID btw. They had the album ready in 2019 and then COVID struck, so they had to go with it. What are the odds, right?). My favorite song from them is Messiah Complex, a 17-minute prog metal epic, off of *Virus*. My favorite album from them is *Affinity*.

Leprous formed in Notodden, Norway 2001. They released a couple demos in the 2000s and their debut album didn't come out until 2009. They've released 6 more albums and a couple singles since then. They've transitioned from prog metal to prog rock and have gotten softer over the years, but they're still somewhat holding onto traditional sounds, and continue to hash out incredible music. Favorite song from them is *The Sky is Red* (11:22), the final track from their album *Pitfalls*. One of the most technically proficient and ominous songs I've ever heard. Favorite album is *Malina*, and it's my most favorite album of all time.

Between the Buried and Me formed in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA in 2000. Their debut self-titled album came out in 2002 and have released 8 more albums since, plus an EP (*The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues*) and a cover album (*The Anatomy Of*). However, I'm not a fan of that EP or their first 3 albums. They're too heavy for my taste. And I don't really care about cover songs, so I don't have their cover album either. But their discography from 2007's *Colors* to their most recent album, 2021's *Colors II*, is out of this world. My favorite album from them is *Colors II* and my favorite song is *Bad Habits* (8:43), off of *Colors II*.",Paragon8384,1640636598

I usually don’t purchase stuff like this but in this case he looked sincere and his tamales were only $2 USD. So I completed the transaction and bid him farewell thinking that was the end of it.

A few weeks later he comes by again selling tamales once more. I say hi to the gentleman  and I accept and purchase  another round. We say goodbye and head our separate ways. 

Now, after a few more weeks he appears again. This time early around 9:30am when he usually drops by at 4pm. I go to unlock the door and let him in but I notice he doesn’t have his container. I found that odd. 

When stepped inside the clinic he had tears in his eyes. His face was wrinkled and the weight of something terrible was on his shoulders, that much was clear by how he looked at me. 

I asked him in Spanish “what happened?”

He just hung his head and this man started weeping, saying that his father passed.

3833,CasualConversation,I'm very sad that I will be commuting by car for a long time,"Over the last couple years I've been slowly learning about how terrible American infrastructure is and how we've paved over our communities to make room for wider roads and more parking lots. 

I would love to just take the bus to work, but it'd take 2 hours to commute one way and the bus schedule would make me 30 minutes late to work anyways. I looked into biking to work but that would take an hour and a half and would require me to bike on dangerous 4-lane roads during rush hour (and in the dark during winter). 

I am so, so jealous of cities with great public transportation. I'd kill for a subway or a really good bus system. Instead I'm stuck in a mid-sized city that is designed entirely around cars!

3839,CasualConversation,Do you have any unique body quirks,"I have a friend with an extra spinal disk in her back. So when she sits down her head is taller than mine, and her little feet don't touch the floor. It's so adorable. She liked to dance though, so she got frustrated about it since her legs were so short in porportion to the rest of her body. She is very feminine and the definition of a soft girl but accidently has giant biceps and abs that she tries to hide. I'm convinced she is the most adorable and lovely person I've ever met.

My bust measurement is the same as my legs. If my top half skin was a fruit roll up and my bust was removed from the bottom half of me and unrolled it would be as long as my legs. So that's weird. It makes me really insecure and uncomfortable but if it wasn't me and my own body I'd probably think I was absolutely beautiful.

How about you? Do you have any unique body quirks or porportions? It's crazy how different bodies are from one another even within families. It's kinda cool when you think about it.

My plan was:

A) Have one account. Turn my personal account into my artist one. Change my username and profile pic to my character, logo or something

B) Open a new one and post different things in each one

Let me explain a little more about me, for you to help me to take a desition

I'm a regular guy that makes music and wants to become an artist and have a fan base, that's why I want to start sharing my music and send them to my insta

The problem i see here is that im not very active in real life or social media so will be kinda hard to have 2 different accounts posting different things, cause you got to be active to maintain your audience

I don't want to start again with my posts and that stuff, so i think I should turn my current account into my artist account

The only reason I don't want to turn my personal account into an artist one are my followers and the people who know me. Maybe they will think "" i want to follow Marco not this beatmaker guy"". Is like I'm not me anymore, it is ""another person""¿

3860,CasualConversation,My two 'closest' friends make no effort to maintain the friendship (22f),"All three of us are in college. One friend (D) lives at home like me and the other girl (R) has to commute a few hours so can't see us as often which is very understandable.

We're in the same classes at college and we started off really close but I realised it was because I made all the effort- I would constantly keep conversation going on our group chat and I would always invite them over and which was never ever reciprocated in any capacity. I've taken a huge step back and we go weeks not talking, even though we're still together in college. Out of all of us, I'm the only one who comes into college regularly whilst they study from home. I'm kind of worried that it will be 0 communication once we graduate. We do gestures like presents but it feels like it's just to tick a box because there's never any 'emotion' or affection attached.

I feel like we don't have the kind of friendship where you can bring them around your family and snap each other mundane things or tell them about something which happened in your day, that is it feels like a working relationship only. For example at Xmas I have to ask them to send a snap or video of their day because I'm genuinely interested, that's what friends do and then I feel like I'm annoying them. It really bugs me because at the start, I would do the most to make them both feel comfortable and welcome at my home (I live with family). D almost always flakes on our plans to go out but as soon as I invite her to my house she comes, which makes me think she doesn't want to make effort on her part. I'm starting to think it's personal because D and R like to do 'spontaneus' outings at ridiculous times and far cities where they know I can't come (I feel like D plans these herself- my work patterns mean I can't come).

Any advice? It's like we're strangers not friends. If R lived in our city I know she'd make more effort but it's just D who's like this. She makes more effort for guys she's speaking to than us ( like she'll say she can't cook and then bake a cake for a guy she barely knows).",stuckskincare,1640619649

Person 2 always starts to speak with person 1 about their plans. I feel left out on the days i know they are hanging out and i’m not invited, the worst part is that person 2 always sends snaps of them hanging out while person 1 doesn’t.

We had a lot of similar hobbies and really managed to hit it off in the friend department. Ultimately he quit a few years ago and we've remained friends since. To give some insight, a decade ago he was an alcoholic (30+ beers every day) and eventually has to be hospitalized when he went sober. He's been sober (from alcohol) since. He's in his early 30s (as am I).

Weed was legalized in our state a few years back and he opened admitted to liking weed. I'm fine with it; I don't do it because I hate how it makes me feel but I don't care if people smoke. Just before COVID I remember him talking about how weed shops were crazy expensive and how he just bought from his dealer still because it was cheap. This is the first time he actually had a full on conversation with me about weed, and being a person who knows nothing about it, I asked some questions and we had a good back &amp; forth about it.

Ever since then it has slowly been getting out of hand of much he talks about weed. At first it was him offering me some when we hung out which I always declined (except once which solidified how much I hated it). Through the end of last year he started talking about how he was going to grow his own, was getting his friends into it, started buying a bunch of paraphernalia like a lot of pipes and bongs and vape pens. Earlier this year he started buying ""bud"" from his friends (idk of that's something different than weed in general) which he uses to make oil. This was literally the last time I've ever had a conversation with him that didn't involve weed in some way shape or form.

Since he started making oils he literally only talks about and lives the ""weed life"". He details that every day for lunch at work (works from home) he drinks a shake with two ""pucks"" of oil, that each contain 100mg THC he equates. He then drinks more when work ends, along with smoking multiple joints and bowls, and taking gummies to help sleep. He admitted that he often gets so high he forgets he's high and keeps smoking. We used to talk about food all of the time but all he does is say things like ""I've decided all I need are my smoothies"" and the only time he reaches out to me is to tell me about something he did after eating too many edibles. He spends hundreds of dollars on delivery weed from businesses. He'll buy six packages of gummies and then eat three of the packages in one sitting.

His wife doesn't smoke but she doesn't care that he does which is fine. It doesn't seem to be affecting his work. I just can't deal with talking about it anymore. It is literally every conversation. Every once in a while we'll get onto a subject that doesn't deal with weed and for a moment I'm happy to talk with him, but it invariably goes back to his edibles that he's perfecting. I can't do it any more. I've tried talking about how he should stop but he doesn't listen. He'll go on breaks where he doesn't smoke to ""get the joy of being high"" back but now he cuts those breaks short because he claims he can't sleep when he stops smoking. It is ""better for his mental health"" that he smokes constantly.

He's literally the last friend I have and I can't see or talk with him anymore. It's depressing.",SparkleFritz,1640607213
3882,CasualConversation,Why do people have kids during pandemic?,"I personally can't understand people who have kids right now. I can understand if it were accidents, because accidents always happen and we all make mistakes. But why do people plan to have kids now?

In 2020 people had this hope that pandemic would end thx to vaccines. No, vaccines are not working very well, Europe is going back to restrictions again. So we can't know when will the pandemic end.

Governments and pharmaceutical companies promised that we can go back to normal life from about this November. They couldn't keep the promise because Omicron happened. 

Who knows what variants would happen next year? Or the next year? Who knows how long we should endure restrictions and overwhelmed hospitals?

Currently everything is much worse than 2020 winter. Ok we now have covid pills. But would they really work? Pfizer promised vaccines will work, then Delta variants appeared, then omicron appeared. Pharmas or government can't keep their promises and we don't know when pandemic would end. 

So...why do some people wanna have kids now? What if hospitals get too overwhelmed when you go through labor? What if the baby has to wear masks all the time? What if worse variants appear when the kid is only about 1-2 years old?

Don't we all have to wait till the pandemic ends?",Fireworks112,1640602548
3883,CasualConversation,Most overused/misused words in 2021,"So this year I've seen a lot of overused/misused words, thought I'd list some of them, let me know if you agree or disagree and even tell me some of your own! (All my examples are real videos which have heavily upvoted comments using the following words) 

1. Narcissist - Everyone is apparently a narcissist these days. 15 year old uploading a video of himself biting his own lip because he thinks he looks attractive, narcissist? No, he's just a kid making videos of himself because he wants girls and he'll look back on it in 5 years and laugh about it. 

Woman happens to be having a bad day and yells at someone on a bus to keep their feet off her chair, narcissist? No, no, no. Imagine all the times you've acted out in public throughout your life, a time you were really sad/mad or just selfish for like 16 seconds, now imagine that's caught on camera, you're now labeled a narcissist by the internet.

2. Karen - yes they definitely exist but now you have people wanting to meet a Karen soooo badly, anytime someone gets in a public argument with a middle aged woman they're put on video for the whole internet to see and judged a Karen, thus escalating the situation and the ""Karen"" starts acting out more (rightly so). If any of us are put on video mid argument we are going to start getting more aggressive.

 It almost seems people on the internet see a video title with the word Karen in it, and all that is required for them to like the video is:
• a middle aged woman
• an argument 

Most of these poor women have been pushed to anger by a bully with a camera and doesn't press record until after they've bullied her so they look like the good guy and can now act all calm, when really you can tell in their voice they're just looking for an excuse to call a middle aged woman a Karen. 

Middle aged woman served undercooked chicken in a fancy restaurant and wants it sent back? Karen.

Middle aged woman asking skateboarders to stop purposely skating really fast near her son in the attempt to make him fall over whilst he's learning? Karen. 

3. Cringe - if someone doesn't like something, they might just say ""cringe"". I think it's the new ""lame"" or ""whatever"", but it's far more overused and completely misused. I don't feel like I have to explain this one too much.

4. Robbed (only appropriate to football fans I think⚽. Just because a team lost 3-1 but maybe should've had a penalty doesn't mean they're robbed of points. If your favourite player didn't get player of the month doesn't mean you have to fill the comments of every sports page with ""(player name) ROBBED"". Just because you don't like a team and they beat the team you wanted to win doesn't mean they're robbed. ""Robbed"" doesn't translate to ""ah I didn't like that"", so use something else, it's boring now.",ApoIIonius,1640602383

3894,CasualConversation,how much of a shutdown do you think is acceptable for a big holiday?,"You know Christmas and such is meant to be a holiday for people but more likely than not a lot of people actually worked harder during that stretch of time. Which i mean, it's fair, the world can't go for a halt otherwise society would crumble

would you mind not being able to go to grocery like at all during 1-2 days leading and on the actual Christmas day? 

obviously, some job is impractical or reckless to stop during the holidays, like emergency room and power grid monitoring. And a shipping container crew would've sailed a month or two before Christmas so it's not like they're skipping 2 months' pay just for a holiday.  but how about a fulfillment center? it's quite a complex logistical nightmare to halt everything but it's not like it's essential right?

for that matter what would you even consider essential/urgent? grocery is essential but you can just do it the day before or after. power and internet should be essential IMO but what about commercial flight 

to be fair though, the overworking during Christmas is like a self-inflicted wound, you want stuff for Christmas so you work harder during Christmas, but would Christmas feel genuinely the same without the overworking beforehand?",ArScrapp,1640596084

3897,CasualConversation,One Incident Can Change Your Whole Perspective,"As much as I depend on my logical thinking than feelings, yet when it comes to wanting kids I only see one possible scenario that involves pain and suffering ""what if.."" for the kids and me. Pessimistic mindset is strong with this one.

**Background:**

Up till summer of 2014 when I was 24yo, I hoped that  I would have two kids by 32. Now 31(m) no kids (still want to get married though). In that summer (when I go back from college) we discovered that my sister (29yo now) has a learning disability after she failed her 3rd semester in college. This made sense for why she struggled socially in communication and not bonding well with the family, along with anger issues, mood swings.  Sometimes she acts like a 10yo and sometimes acts her age and she's aware that she has a learning disability but she only thinks it's related to studying, so do my parents.  

She dropped from two colleges in the US and went back home and enrolled in an online college to avoid interaction with people since she had a bad experience with her roommates in her 2nd year due to lacking social skills. She graduated two years ago and struggling to find a job that suites her case because she doesn't want something that involves interaction with people and at the same time she would like it too. She can take care of herself, cook, order stuff, recently she learned driving and started going out by herself as long as there's another adult living with her and give her money. 

**Results:**

Seeing my parents fail to deal with this issue over the years, my mom 62yo living in constant worries ""what's gonna happen to her after we are gone? ... if only she get a job I will be relieved"". Me seeing my sister in pain and can't comprehend why her life is not like the rest of people over the years, sensing my mom's worries when she randomly brings my sister's situation made me not want to be in her shoes at that age where she should be relaxing. I decided not to have kids to avoid seeing them suffer while I'm helpless which would cause me to suffer too. 

Not to mention that over the years the sad stories related to kids that I heard like the Boston mom who committed suicide by driving into a lake along with her down syndrome 20yo boy because she couldn't take it anymore and was afraid of what's going to happen to him made my stand stronger. I can say that I'm not ready financially to make a family, but I know that just a cover excuse for the real reason (I also going to take care of my sister financially after my parents). My other sister recently got married and already thinking of kids names and I'm like ""why I'm affected by sister case but it didn't affect her""

While good stories have no to so little effect to change my mind. Although my reason for wanting to have kids is for the social life aspect of it when I'm in my 50+, like the family gathering with grandparents. Even though this is one possible scenario that might not happen too for different reasons.

I'm a short, slight woman with a disportionately sized bust that I'm honestly, really uncomfortable about. My sister showed me how to measure myself and where to put the tape and we wrote down the numbers. It was kinda sweet. But then, afterwards she's like ""uh, sis, did you notice....?"" I'm 37 around my bust and my legs are 37 inches long. Do you know how weird that is? If my skin was a fruit roll up and my boob half were cut off of my bottom half, unwrap it and it would be as long as my legs. That's fucking weird! Not just the fruit roll up for skin part. 

I had a friend in high school who had an extra spinal disk in her back. So whenever i would sit beside her, her head would be higher than mine but her feet wouldn't touch the floor.

Yeah, “be yourself” is great advice for people who are just nervous about isolated situations, but there’s a whole swath of us that have to avoid being ourselves at all costs.

For us the “anxiety demon” is an absolute necessity. It’s how we are able to work in the world. Can this be fixed? I think so.

I think I’ve pinned it down; the difference, that is; and it goes deep and it’s hard to change, but it all comes down to one question:

Are you interacting to learn or to inform?

I’m open to opinions, but I think the former is where some people live and the latter is a space occupied by the anxious and that it’s a trap that causes us to constantly have to explain ourselves and worry.

I’ve been self-testing this with interactions and I really think I’m onto something. If you let that informative mind take a back seat and just ‘interact to learn’, the pressure disappears, because learning isn’t a performance.

3922,CasualConversation,"It’s lost in time, now","You know, sometimes when I’m sitting in bed, alone at the end of the day, I start thinking back to last year. 

I had a good job, would spend the weekdays working 12 hour day/night shifts at a factory then hang out at my kinda sorta maybe boyfriend’s house on Sundays. Saturdays I would spend wishing it was Sunday or looking forward to going back to work. 

At his place, I would knock on the door, he’d open it with a really cute smile and I’d come inside. After the usual greetings I’d awkwardly stand in the living room, not knowing where to sit while he puttered around the kitchen. He’d come out, still smiling and sit down, and I’d follow. After sifting through Netflix or prime video for awhile, we’d settle on a movie. For a couple hours, it was just me and him on the couch, maybe cracking a couple jokes about the movie or just enjoying each other’s company. Every little while or so he would gently tilt my head up to his, and we’d kiss. 

We told each other some deep secrets, sitting there on that couch. Sometimes we’d turn on music quietly in the background, and just talk for hours. It felt so calming and safe.

I really don’t know where it turned bad, somewhere within all the different lockdowns that kept us from seeing each other outside of work I guess. Either way, he changed midway through the relationship. By the time we actually defined it as “dating,” the man I met was already long gone. 

More cancellations, more excuses instead of being together, more obvious examples of us not fitting together like we thought. Many more nights spent crying in my car after dropping him off, because even after 6 hours talking like we normally do, I could still feel the divide between us and couldn’t find a way to mend it.

I remember the music I listened to while I was on the way to his house for the first time. Listening to it now takes me back to last year. I had to quit my job for college, and I haven’t seen him in four months now. Sometimes now when i’m home I drive past his place, and my hand still wants to turn the wheel and go to his door. Expecting that after a knock, he would open it with that same smile. But knowing if I did, I would instead be greeted by a blank stare.

3927,CasualConversation,Are comforter sets more for show and am I an asshole?,"My mom got me a comforter set for Christmas and it was $200! All it is is a thick blanket, 2 small accent pillows (the kind you see on couches), shams for the pillows and a bedskirt. I'm sorry but I just don't see how this is $200 and I feel bad because she wanted to give me something nice. Which it is but I don't know how convenient they are. The pillows are mostly for show, comforters are thick and scratchy, it's not really something you sleep with, it's mostly for show. Same with bedskirts. My room is small and it gets hot fast, my bed is kinda weird and it's low to the ground. I don't really wanna sleep with a thick comfortable on me too often, it just seems like a for show thing. I feel bad that she spent $200 on this set because it looks nice, I just don't know how much I'm going to use it. I dont really need it much, I just need a few covers and my pillows and I'm good. I'll just be moving the comforter around a lot since it isn't something I really want to sleep with (it's uncomfortable sleeping under them, they don't feel snug and cozy like regular blankets but cold and rough). It's the kinda thing you'll see in fancy guest rooms and hotels but I don't really know how convenient it is sleeping under them. I don't want my bed to feel like a hotel bed lol those are uncomfortable. 

I kinda set her a text saying the same thing, along with me being very grateful and appreciating it but also stating I know she spent over a hundred dollars on this (scan tag says $199.99), and I know she wanted to give me something comfortable to sleep with my son with. I just don't know if it's that comfortable, especially in a tiny room. My son is gonna have other blankets to wrap around in so he also doesn't really need a big comforter.

3956,CasualConversation,"I am curious, is there a ""Cycle of Worthlessness"" and how to persevere through it? (LONG STORY)","Now the title is super confusing, so let me explain. 

I myself a friendless guy, and it was my reality since my birth. If I was gone no one would or care to remember of my existence besides my family. So one day I was watching a video, it wasn't the classical cliche of ""how to make friends"", but instead something different. I sadly unable to show it, since I can't remember what was the video, but I do remember to context. 

In it, it was stated that humans like to stick to others they find of ""use"". Basically people will notice you for your skills/talent and therefore would want to be around you, forming a friendship (excluding attractiveness). Same goes in your social status and your overall achievements. This basically summarizes it. 

And so I thought that all it took is to be good at something, join the hobbie, and be around with others. But the issue is that no one will notice you if you don't stand out. And so you gotta stand out with your talent. But my issue is that I have no talent. And I say that literally. Nor do I have any hobbie because of that. And so I thought I couldn't learn anything. Until one month weird thing happened.

Now I was accepted into an art school (which I left seeing them not teaching anything, aka modern art stuff), but what interested me wasn't the visual art sector, but instead the creative writing one. And for a backstory, I had a dream which required ""4 elements"", one of those being narration. Which I absolutely hated because of my poor English. 

Regardless, basically what happened is that we there required to participate in a technology class (teaching about internet and stuff like that) by their county. But since the building's sectors there under reconstruction many, especially elderly teachers have temporarly left. And so other teachers from other sectors there told to substitute in those classes for the rest of the year. And one of those was a young creative writing teacher who used to publish her own books. Now was she good at that class? No, but she was quite extrovertic personality, especially in comparison with our dull class. Now I did had a sci fi I was writing. But I was more so a trash bin activity. I never saw my work being worth by anyone, even by myself. But regardless, one day she has talking about her carrier and how she's a creative writer. And so one day after class, I've came up to her to present my sci fi adventure novel. And to my surprise she liked it. It didn't feel like it was ""mother likes anything her child does"" kind of thing, since she did appear to furrowly read it, re-tell some of crucial parts and sometimes give advice. And to say that it was motivational, would be an understatement. Now finding someone who actually likes my work I started continuing to write my novel or almost daily basis, further and further expanding it little by little. I've even became confident enough to shown the girls near me in the cafeteria my work, which they also liked. I've even remember the guy come up to me saying ""you are that guy who writes a novel?"". It felt heartwarming, and it was an unexpected change for me. I hated writing and reading. Since my childhood I was forced to read things I absolutely hated. Those bland generic stories you can see in any library shelf. Which further piled up my hateried with my poor understanding of English. And now, I was doing and enjoying the thing I once absolutely despised. I was motivated, I was seen, I was appreciated by others. But one day it all came down.

Due to some complications I was forced to leave the art school and go into the generic school we all are attributed to. So I lost all the contacts I had previously made in the said art school. This was already traumatizing. But it wasn't the worst. I tried to continue writing, and showing it. I showed it to uninspired students in the school who there all consumed in their phones. No reply. I even tried communicating with my English teacher, but she read it and it was just silence. Nothing. And so I was left alone, with my work, with no one but myself to look over it. And just like that I've yet again abandoned it. But in a way it showed me a lesson, of how much others have influence over you. And so now I got confused.

Maybe it could be me who feels extremely desperate. But I did see the effects of motivation and being appreciated by others. And so does that mean that it's an endless cycle of which a person can't break from by their own? In order to be recognized, you need a talent, but in order to have a talent you need to be recognized. 

So in the end what do you think, what's you experience with it, and would you deal or even dealt with it. I appreciate people's views, as it shows me more about the world. Thanks to everyone who expressed it :)",NoCareNoLife,1640577387

3969,CasualConversation,Do you think old or new internet culture will be better remembered over time?,"It seems like throughout the years the amount of internet content has grown at an exponential rate. Some of it more memorable than others.

As time goes on I've wondered what pieces of internet culture will be remembered and to what extent. 

My gut tells me relatively older stuff will be better remembered because there was less noise to breakthrough and (at least to me) content seemed less niche whereas now everything is optimized to your feed. On the flip side, as we continue moving forward we'll see more people engaged in internet culture and some of it should catch fire and gain more views, right? 

Maybe internet culture will parallel mediums like music or TV where options have increased but you can recall highlights from any time period. Maybe there is too much noise and it's too niche that outside of smaller pockets most specific internet culture won't be remembered outside of the platforms or websites that we engaged on.

The area that I went to is known for being visited by majority Caucasian Americans and locals from other parts of Mexico. I am Mexican American. Born and raised in Los Angeles all my life, but my face tells another story.

My mom told me that I should make some friends, and there were a bunch of kids my age playing a volleyball game in the pool. I joined in, even though I'm not very athletic. Most people were from Mexico, but there were about four kids from the States. One of the boys from the states started making passive aggressive comments. I can't even remember what they were, because I didn't think he was talking about me. But I remember looking at him a couple of times wondering who he was talking about.

The ball hit me in the face, knocking off my sunglasses. One of my teammates, a Spanish speaking woman, told me where they fell. I didn't even register that she spoke to me in Spanish, so I asked super loudly ""what did you say?""

After that, the kid that was talking bad started instructing me on how to throw the ball. He was being super nice and patient. If I threw it successfully, he congratulated me. If I didn't, he'd say ""progress"" or ""good try"". Looking back at it now, he was talking about me.

I'm happily married, and we have an adorable and loving 4yo boy together. In addition, I'm also sharing our house with my older sister and her mellow yet affectionate 10yo son. I've helped raise my nephew since he was 2 years old, so I kind of became his father figure for the time being.  My son is more affectionate with Mum compared to me, and he was sleeping with her in our room during this event.

It's the day after Christmas, and what's better than snuggling in bed with your loved ones and chill out? And we did just that, with my nephew deciding to invite me to his room for a little gaming (and eventual cuddling) session for the night. I sat on his bed next to him, and we played lots of stuff on the Nintendo Switch in his room, ranging from FIFA to Mario Kart. Then he said he started to feel a bit tired and wanted to lay down on my lap. I had asked if he wanted to go to sleep so I could turn the Switch off, but he told me he wanted to continue playing. Around half an hour later, he fell asleep with his head resting on my lap, snoring softly while laying on his side. He looked angelic and serene, and I cuddled him for a bit, caressing his cheeks as he rested on my left leg. Then I turned him over to his back, tucked him into a blanket and kissed him good night before turning the Switch and the TV off and leaving his room, ending our gaming night together. It's 11:30pm here, and I'm enjoying my late night whiskey while typing this.

4020,CasualConversation,Who else feels lonely as hell right now?,"31F. Christmas holidays are always the worst for me. I know a lot of us feels this way, and I would like a place to simply vent about it in a casual way. I’m not looking for consolation, my story isn’t that bad and it could be much worst. I guess I just want to get it off my chest and hear about yours as well, so we both know we are not alone in this, that we don’t have a problem, that we are not inapt or exceptionally unlucky.

This is the time of the year where I’m forced to face the fact that my family is falling apart, and that I don’t have that many real friends or at least that I might not be as important for them as they are for me. Or maybe I am, in a different way.

Christmas Eve was tough, half of the family was away with my father and I was with my two older brothers who are being verbally abusing to me on a regular basis. It’s also the day my mother passed 8 years ago, which doesn’t help with the flow. The evening was not terrible in itself, it was just not great, as if we were only here because we had to, not because we really wanted to, and that is a sad feeling to have with your closest family. 

New Year’s Eve is even worst. I am not a « group » person. All of my friends are doing stuff on their own, going to dinners and parties, and none of them offered for me to join. They know I have nothing going on, that I’ll probably spend the evening by myself, yet none of them made the effort of including me in their plans. I try my best not to take offense, in a way I can understand, I don’t even like to party, I don’t drink much, and why would any of them have the responsibility. I don’t know. I spend a lot of time alone, and I am fine with it most of the time, but this one particular day is hard to take in. It feels like a mirror of all my failures. 

I hate Christmas and New year’s Eve, I hate the social obligation to gather and be sociable animals. I have that it left a lot of us loners feel inadequate. 

What are your feeling on this? Did you have a shitty Christmas Eve as well? Do you have plans for New Year’s Eve, and if not, do you have a good way to cope? Are you sad or have you found peace ?

Aircraft engines over head, the river of cars meandering along a highway a few miles off in the distance. Trains and light rail. People living their busy lives creating the low hum of industrialized society; it may disappear into our subconscious but it's still there.

Even in residential neighborhoods, it's barking dogs, playing children, leaf blowers and power tools, TVs or radios ringing out from an open window. Cars making their way down the streets, the Doppler sound of distant sirens piercing the air. Even the wind in the trees or the chirping of the birds; it's *always* there. ...So all the more reason why this was such a special moment.

I was outside, mid morning, going about my day in a moderately busy neighborhood, when suddenly it happened. It was like someone had it ""pause"". Like the synchronicity of conversations in a crowded noisy room that unexpectedly comes to a collective silence. But there was nothing awkward about this. It was blissful; like finding yourself in the spaces in between the frames of a film. I stood there, in that moment, taking it all in and wanting it not to end. No planes, no cars, no wildlife, no people noises, nothing, just peaceful calm. 

It wasn't just the silence either, there are plenty of places you can go for that, or the absence of life, quite the opposite.

4045,CasualConversation,I’m applying to a job I’m under qualified for.,"I (F/25) don’t have a degree. It was completely my decision to not finish. I’ve worked since I was 14 and quite honestly have always loved working. I have always gotten great grades and was even chosen to acquire business credits at Stanford when I was 15 (which I obviously did!) College just wasn’t for me. After working food &amp; beverage for about 7 years, I got my real estate license six months ago. 
  
 I’ve always wanted to do something real estate related, but my driving force to finally get it was I finally got out of an abusive relationship. One where I was constantly told I was dumb. I was so motivated and relieved when I got my license and got a job at an amazing real estate firm. But as it turns out, I’m not loving this specific side of real estate (residential). 

I recently applied for a business development job with the city. It’s a career I would absolutely love and I know I would be good at. However, I know my application is lacking and my ex’s words are starting to haunt me again. I’m thinking of writing a personal email to the hiring office but not sure how to explain that I know I’m under qualified but I’m an extremely hard worker and I know I would be good at it.

I hate getting annoyed by phone calls and she keeps calling like every half an hour annoying me(she claims this is not considered annoying, while i consider it yes it is). Another thing she keeps talking bad about my brother because one time in the past he acted bad with me, but i personally forgot and forgave him. She wouldn't change her opinion about him and thats getting on my nerves how she speaks about him badly.
Also second problem is her father, i feel him unbearable. He acts rude to his wife(my gf momma). Even at me sometimes. He screams at me, at them. He doesnt work and stays at home potatocouching and smoking and watching tv, i cannot interact with him more than 5 seconds.
Her brother also same as father.
The only postivie thing is that her mother is not from this world how good is she, she is a great person, passionate, even though her husband behaves like this with her.
And another positive thing is my gf is so positive and humble. But sometimes toxic towarda my brother as i mentioned above.
Note: the phone calls thing is keeping me stressed all day all time. Because this thing is repeated all day long and no matter how hard i try she doesnt understand. So im stressed all the time

Some effing kidnapers saw him on the street and took him to the butcher and now he might be in some old man's stomach. I don't know... I can't really tell but it's a thing here. They take random cats and dogs on the street and sell them to restaurant for money. That next day, I suddenly woke up at 6am and I cried thinking about him. Yesterday I just had a dream he came back but in that dream, he didn't have mouth or nose. He was there, I picked him up but when I looked at him, there were only the eyes that look back at me. I can still hear him meowing but there's nothing here. I follow a lot of accounts with videos of cats, dogs, pets... Now looking at those videos, I can't smile anymore.

Ever since I was a kid the mental abuse/games that would be thrown at me molded me into this guy I am today. I’m always apologizing, I’m always alone because I’d rather not be hurt by anyone, I get into relationships and then leave them because I don’t know how to handle anyone genuinely being interested in me (although I am currently with someone I am enjoying being with), and I give everything I have because I was always forced to do it in order to not get yelled at or messed with by my family and it’s just easier that way. I stay locked in my place because it’s what makes me feel safest. I would love to genuinely experience a concert or a club (hated what I had experienced at a club). The thing is as a kid I was forced to work with my family if I didn’t I’d be told I was a bad kid or that I didn’t love my family. Until about half way through high school I was always manipulated into giving up whatever time I had for the family business or I was just a shitty person. Then when I started making money I got sob stories about whatever was going on to help them out. If I did I was hailed a hero if I couldn’t I was a piece of shit. Then covid hit. Gave 10k to my mom for her business (I’ll probably never see it again) to keep it a float during these crazy times. I asked if I’ll ever get it back then got some hate filled rant about how ungrateful I am and how I was given so much that it’s ridiculous I ask for the money back. I had to move in because I love my jobs. I now have 2 jobs again and was recently told that my folks would be going on vacation and that I had to run the shop (not something I can do right now seeing as I have no time) I was met with threats and anger. So now I plan on packing my things leaving and living out of my car for a little bit until I raise the money needed to get an apartment. I was going to join the military but it doesn’t seem all that possible anymore but who knows. All I know is I’m done. I’m tired of the games and the toxic environment and the manipulation.

I’m 31 and I have a pretty good relationship with each of my (divorced) parents, we talk on the phone at least once a month, they both are very kind, caring people. I live far away and don’t get to see them much, so maybe that’s partly why a gift at the holidays feels important to me.

i’m just sad. my mom didn’t give me anything, not even a card, and my dad gave me an awkward thing I have to go return now and feel guilty about not liking it (it’s an impractical piece of furniture. I live in a 450 sqft apartment.)

I guess I should have a conversation with each of them but that feels uncomfortable and messed up too. my partner doesn’t have to explain to his parents how to give nice/normal gifts, I feel like most people don’t have this problem. it’s not like I expect lavish gifts, it’s just like…. why is it so hard to just give something simple to say you’re thinking of me?",jazzisaurus,1640512558

4117,CasualConversation,"Guy (19M) started making passive aggressive comments about me (21F), not realizing that I speak English","I (21F) went on vacation to Mexico. The place that I went to is usually filled with Caucasian American tourists and people from Mexico. I am Mexican American, so I look Mexican, even though I speak both languages.

One day, I played a water polo game with some kids my age. I'm not very athletic, and I didn't want to play initially, but my mom made me, encouraging me to make friends. There were some kids from Mexico, but most of them were from the States. One of the boys that was on the same team as me started making passive aggressive comments. He wasn't saying anything specifically about me, but he was saying stuff like ""hopefully I can make up for that last serve"" (after I served the ball). I ignored him, because whatever. I'd look at him every now and then, hoping he'd get the hint.

However, one time, the ball hit me in the face and my sunglasses fell off. One of the people playing told me where my glasses were in Spanish. I didn't hear her, I didn't even register that she was speaking to me in Spanish, so I said really loudly in English ""wait, what did you say?""

Afterwards, he started instructing me on how hit and serve the ball. If I did well, he told me ""good job"", and if I missed or the ball didn't reach past the net, he'd say ""progress"", and smile at me. Did he realize he was being kind of a jerk and felt bad after? Or was just doing that to save face?

Tl;dr: guy started talking bad about me about my water polo skills, not realizing that I understood the same language. After, he tried teaching me, and telling me good job or just trying to encourage me. Did he feel bad or was he just trying to save face?",hecatearrowkey11,1640511734

I dunno. I will randomly go out to my moms house or my dad's house throughout the year but will avoid going to spend time with them during any holiday. I've never really enjoyed any holiday (except st Patrick's day but day drinking used to be my thing so there's that). But as I've gotten older and older I just see how either side of my family gets crazier and crazier as Christmas approaches and it just puts me in a pissy ass mood until its all finally over. Like my mom trying to stretch out her bills so she can afford to buy everyone she has ever known at least one present for Christmas (family gets 3, me and my sis get 4 to 5 even if I tell her don't get me anything). Or just things around my dad and step mom getting more and more up tight about everything being perfect and clean and doting on my lil sis (she deserves it though so that's not really a problem I have, just don't like being around it a whole lot and don't like being involved). 


Also I really wanted to order a pizza last night but dominoes was closed and I just woke up even more pissed off this morning.

4144,CasualConversation,Life is going to hell. Vented on my Christmas family speech and nobody noticed.,"My family and I (25, M) are from Mexico City. Only me, a cousin and my brother speak English and nobody else does.

Every year, someone from the family gives a speech before having dinner (very clicheic IK). 
This Christmas we had guests from the US (they speak spanish perfectly tho), so my dad and uncles insisted on me to give the speech in both EN and SPA, so they could ""flex"" on our guests.

I wasnt in the mood to speak to anyone because I'm in a very rough point in my life with dark thoughts and 0 tolerance. 
Specially from the fact that a day before I had a disappointing discovery about my girlfriend and her ex. I just wasn't -and Im not- in a great place right now but they don't know it and I'm not willing to tell anyone because they NEVER support me at anything.

Anyways, they were so insisting about it so I told to myself... why not?.
And I fucking did it. I gave a christmas speech but not the one they wanted.

I put a fake smile and looked them in the eyes, held my tears and I told them everything. I told them I might break up with someone that I considered the love of my life. I told them I dont like half of the people sitting on the table. I told them I am beyond tired. I told them I have no peace of mind  and I wished them a merry Christmas. I did it in a way tbey wouldnt suspect and as unbelievable as it seems IT ACTUALLY WORKED. And they all gave me a round of applause and we all raised our glasses and cheered and they had NO clue of what I just said except for my brother, my cousin and our guests.

I CANT BELIEVE IT WORKED! And If it wouldn't have worked, I couldn't care less because my whole world changed and them thinking I could be rude is the least of my worries right now. They get it for pressuring me on doing this.

Im not going to lie, it was one of the most liberating moments Ive experienced so far.

Anyways. Minutes after that shit speech, I went to our guests, my cousin and my brother and I asked them to not say anything of what I vented about. Our guests were so chill and they wished me the best and my brother and cousin saiagreed they wont say nothing but they were in shock.

4148,CasualConversation,How do I tell my parents I don't want Facebook?,"My brother and his friends came over to visit for Christmas and I sort of made friends with one of his friends after boding over our same interest in Gunpla. He then asked if I had Facebook so we could chat and later today my parents and brother thought it was a good time to join Facebook. They did make a good point about making new friends but my answer for not wanting Facebook goes deeper than that and I'm terrible with words.

1. I have no idea what Facebook is like or how the people actually work on there. Now me and my parents are not stupid, we both know someone could easily DM me their entire dickpic collection and like and social network strong emotions are thrown around like bullets. They did tell me that I could join groups of people with similar interests but that leaves me on too my second point.
2. I prefer reddit instead mainly because nobody cares about you and you don't have to give two shits about any other account. I have heard a lot that reddit can get very toxic like other networks but maybe its the type of subreddits I'm on or I'm just been completely lucky but I haven't experienced anything like that since I first joined.
3. I have a very short social battery and the only way I can make friends is if we're both discussing the same interest for several hours. I have a lot of trouble making friends and even more so keeping a conversation for more than 2 minutes.
4. I don't like the idea of having more than one social network. I'm perfectly content with just having reddit as my main source of questions on the internet and having two accounts with do the same thing conceptually doesn't feel right and I would probably just use one instead of the other most of the time.

There might be some good reasons to join Facebook but there are things that I don't even want to touch mentally of verbally. Is Facebook as bad as people make it or am I just stressing way too hard. Maybe to those who do have Facebook or Twitter can answer these questions for me.

Either way Merry Christmas and have a decent new year.",ah-screw-it,1640501243

4160,CasualConversation,A platonic LDR has left me crazy.,"I (24M) got to meet her (29F) through reddit two years ago and been sharing our lives with each other ever since on an almost daily basis. We live on different continents yet I've never felt closer to anyone else. This emotional attachment only increased with time despite our ups &amp; downs. We usually overlooked our differences and helped each other cope through the difficult times. It came to the point that whenever i experienced anything interesting in my life, she was the only one i felt like sharing it with.

This relationship did get romantic at times but we had to make each other realize that being together physically was very difficult due to geographic, societal and cultural reasons. Other issues were also involved regarding our personalities with me being somewhat conservative and her being rather reckless at times.

For those wondering how an LDR worked for us for almost two years, we used to watch movies together, share music, talk about our issues in daily life on text and videocalls and even send each other gifts like food deliveries etc. There were also insightful discussions related to mental health and spiritual beliefs among other things. 

Two weeks ago she was at a bar drinking way more than she had to. We were on a call for 2 hours which was fun but i also repeatedly asked her to take it easy on the alcohol.
The next day she messaged me to notify that her dad her hit her and she had lost hearing in one of her ears. She also mentioned that she overheard her parents discuss sending her to rehab since she had been drinking alot whilst being unemployed for a couple of months. We talked for two more days after this until she went offline for what seems like forever. Its been 10 days now and she still hasn't come online. My paranoid mind thought it was her either ghosting or blocking me at first but then the rational thoughts came into play and now I'm thinking that she actually might be in rehab or just detoxing herself from the world.

Now i don't want to intrude but i still have the option to call her on her local number through roaming. I can also try to contact her best friend through Instagram but that might make me seem like Joe from You.

A main thing I forgot to emphasize on was our rollercoaster of a relationship where i usually felt like i was always oversharing. After discussing this concern with her, she blatantly pointed out the fact that her life was boring and she loved to hear from me. IRL im an ambivert but mostly inclined towards the introverted side so getting to talk to her was kinda like a blessing in disguise but it also got very frustrating at times to the point where I wished that things would slowly die off. This is not me being selfish and insensitive its just that i wanted the best for her aswell because she often used to mention that she needed someone physically and i felt that i was getting in her way.

Talking to her was also leading me to bipolar thoughts because one day we would be optimistic and cheerful and the next day would be dreadful and filled with just sad vibes.

But coming to the conclusion, i just really miss her and at the same time im kinda relieved to be getting some space aswell. I dont know how to deal with this but I've learned my lesson to not get so much emotionally involved with someone halfway across the world again. I also forgot to mention that she is bipolar and she usually used to let me know beforehand when things got manic for her, i guess maybe this also led to me having mixed feelings about her in out daily interactions because i was the one mostly trying to comfort her which drained me sometimes. 

But once again i really miss her and maybe some time off is gonna help us both to re-evaluate this all and focus on ourselves.

I don't dislike him at all but siblings have a special knack for getting on your nerves.


Tonight at our family Christmas get-together, he asks my wife for our keys to move our van so he can park behind us and he snuck a brand new PS5 into the back that I didn't discover until the family event had ended.


I am a full time working parent with 2 small children and another one on the way and wouldn't have been able to afford a PS5 for years to come.

My mom asked why I looked so sad and unhappy, and she even let me paint her nails and she painted mine.   It was then I realized she didn't hate nail polish, just me using markers. 🙃.

4178,CasualConversation,"You didn't cut me off, and you didn't have to pay for my McDonald's","But thank you kind stranger

So I was just in the drive through line at McDonald's, and being that it was the only option open on Christmas I braved the hour long line so my wife didn't have to cook. We both worked today (12 hour shifts), her on graveyard getting off this morning, so we both have little energy or desire to cook for the kids or ourselves after a few sleepless nights of gift wrapping and working (I'll cook tomorrow)

My local McDonald's has a 2-Lane system for ordering that merges to a single line for pay and pick-up. I am about as polite and patient as a Canadian Choir boy, so when my (right) line starts moving I elect to wait for the person in the left (still ordering) so they may go ahead. I did this to preserve the 1-for-1 ""zipper merge"" philosophy I think everyone should adopt, regardless if it's for highways or hamburgers.I was scrolling reddit the entire time in line, so I really wasn't concerned about waiting an extra 2 minutes.

Unbeknownst to me the person I had allowed to merge **somehow believed *they* had cut *me* off** and told the worker at the window they felt bad. Whether it was genuinely out of some misplaced guilt (it really was their turn to go, I swear) or maybe it was just Holiday spirit, this person had paid for my entire family's meal! I sat there utterly flabbergasted that this person was even more polite and guilt ridden then I've ever felt in a fast food line. And this was no cheap McD ticket either...

As I sat there and collected my thoughts on how this (probably actual Canadian) had come to such a misguided conclusion I overheard the window workers chatting about a charity chain that had started in a similar fashion some months earlier.

I said screw it, handed the employee a near equivalent amount of cash my bill would have been, and asked them to cover whoever was behind me as well (might've covered a few cars)

To my Misguided Mystery Canadian, thank you. You put a smile on my face this Christmas and it was truly needed. I hope everyone who was able continued to pay it forward.

I was living with my Dad. A year before he passed my aunt &amp; her teenage son moved in with us because they got evicted. My Dad passed &amp; my aunt &amp; I started splitting rent &amp; all the bills 2 ways. At that point I was making $15 an hour full time so I brung in around 31k pretax. She was college educated &amp; worked a more stable position at the same company as me and was salary. I believe she made a little under 50k (severely underpaid). Rent was $1500, water bill could be as high as $250 at times. Towards the last few months of us living together her son got a job at Subway and didn't have to pay a cent, he kept all his money to himself. We all moved out in August of this year. At one point I did feel like I was being cheated because when I was a teenager my Mom made me give money for rent to take a toll off her back. But I was stuck in a house splitting rent 2 ways with 3 people. Yeah he worked a minimum wage job but I felt like he could've pitched in one way or another. It didn't help that he left the lights on in every room &amp; didn't hesitate to offer to pay for his food if I was getting take out for myself &amp; asked if he wanted me to pick him something up.

4231,CasualConversation,alone with a broken knee for the holidays,"laid up with a broken and probably torn kneecap from training a couple days ago.

friends and roommate all gone home for the holidays but will be returning to the city sporadically so ill have company and help soon. for now im just kicking it working thru the limited amount of percocet they gave me. maybe my tolerance is high from all the IV opiates in the hospital but it doesn’t feel as fun as i would have expected.

cant carry stuff while on crutches so im taking my food from the kitchen with me in this little hard bottom tote bag i hold in my mouth. i know what you’re thinking: it feels incredibly primal to grip my claim in my teeth and take my keep back into my den.

distracting myself with easy to watch, lowest-common-denominator hollywood movies from the 21st century. given up on my usual preferences as i was gonna try and work thru my film backlog but my pain addled mind couldnt really properly appreciate stuff like “the face of another” or  “ali: fear eats the soul.”

don’t look up was very bad. 22 jump street was surprisingly good.

will be requesting a handicap seat in the theater because i’m still gonna try and go see the new apichatpong weerasethakul movie next week.

been a fairly bleak holiday season following a quarantine cancelled thanksgiving but spirits are decent for now and im gonna keep taking the pill-pill as long as they’ll allow me. maybe i can score some more good dope off the surgeon when i go in for my consultation/MRI.

4234,CasualConversation,My GF and I are “taking some time to figure things out” and I’m not dealing with it well,"So, yeah. About a week and a half ago I (32m) walked out on my girlfriend (32f) after waking up the morning after a night of drinking that turned into arguing. Not the first time we got into it while drunk, but the morning in question I just felt I couldn’t take it anymore. 
After calming down I regretted acting as erratic as I did and tried to make contact with her. It took a few days but when we finally met up we went for a walk together and we both agreed that things weren’t working the way they were, but we both felt like we shouldn’t be throwing our relationship away just like that. We’ve met and talked a few times since then, and the last time was really nice. We talked things out, at least I got to say the stuff that was on my mind, and spent the night together. The next morning we both left the city we live in to visit our respective families for Christmas and we won’t see each other before at least January 4th or so. 

The way we left it, I told her that what I wanted was to build I life with her, but I couldn’t honestly say that I was sure we would be able to work things out like that. I am willing to try though. She told me she wanted the same, but she is too depressed and confused to commit to something like that. We decided, her suggestion, that we “put things on pause” over Christmas and take it from there. She was very much looking forward to going home to be with her family, and I really wish her a beautiful holiday. I think it will be really good for her, no matter what happens with her and me. 

Now I’m at my moms place, just me and my mom. Apart from a few quick “merry Christmas” texts, I haven’t talked to my GF for four days. I want her to have the space she needs, but honestly it’s driving me crazy. I’ve never been good at being patient in situations like this. Doesn’t help our country (Norway) is in the midst of winter and yet another round of lockdowns. Me and my GF both work in the service industry, so everything feels so unsure. I was supposed to spend New Years with her and her family at their cabin to, which feels like shit. 

Anyway. Happy Christmas everybody!",ztupeztar,1640475741
4235,CasualConversation,I finally took the Coke/Pepsi Challenge!,"I honestly don't know what took me so long. I remember seeing the commercials when I was a kid about people doing a blind taste test with two cups (one with coke and one with pepsi) and revealing that they liked pepsi more. What I lacked was the ability to get both sodas at that age, and the fact that when I was of money age, I'd forgotten about the challenge entirely.

In my high school psychology class, my teacher did a day where she performed the Coke/Pepsi challenge to see if students *could tell which is which*. But she was sneaky and gave half the class two cups of coke. I understand *why* she did it that way, since someone could claim they're different when they were actually the same, but it still seemed dumb. Either way, I missed that day, so I never got to take the test.

Then today (yes, Christmas day), I went to grab gas and for the first time I was looking at two bottles, realizing that I always wanted to do this test and never did. So I bought one bottle of Pepsi and one of Coke, took them home, poured equal amounts into identical cups (pepsi had a piece of tape on the bottom), and move the cups around with my eyes closed while listening to music and counting random numbers. Basically, I did everything I could to lose focus on which cup was in each hand, since I only need to prove it to myself.

I did this twice, and **both times I was right! I accurately guessed which was Pepsi and which was Coke!**

But here is a bit of a takeaway.

1. My sense of smell absolutely failed me. The first cup I picked up, I said ""Yup, smells like Pepsi!"" and it was Coke. So thankfully I didn't judge from smell alone.
2. The challenge was more difficult than I thought it would be. For a moment I wasn't sure which was which. This is why I did it twice, to make sure my first guess wasn't a fluke. My first guess, I was only about 60% sure I was right, and on my second guess I was 90% sure I was right.
3. Pepsi only has 2 more grams of sugar than coke, but if you really pay attention, you can tell it is ever so slightly sweeter. It has a *sharper* taste while coke is slightly more smooth. This still wasn't enough to convince me I was right.
4. The biggest giveaway was the carbonation. I knew how pepsi felt on my tongue regardless of flavor, and that's what drove me the most to realize which one was Pepsi. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was a fun, cheap experiment that I suggest anyone try. But the entire challenge was made up to fing out which beverage people prefer. **So, which do I prefer?**

The answer is: It depends on my mood and purpose.

Coke - This is what my family purchased when I was a kid. I find Coke to be the preferred drink if I'm having it with a meal, or if stuff is being mixed into it (be it flavorings or alcohol). Coca-Cola is the drink that *pairs well* with others. It's a team player.

Pepsi - I drank this more as a teen and in college. Is best when it's on its own. If you want something refreshing between meals, or if you're on a long drive somewhere. Pepsi stands out rather than blending well with the crowd.

Due to those reasonings, when it comes time for a caloric beverage, Coke does usually win out for me. But Pepsi still has a place in my life for those occasions where I just want a soda and nothing else. I'm happy both are here to stay.

4236,CasualConversation,"We all have Santa anecdotes, theories and experiences. What are yours?","My pet theory is that Santa uses Time Travel to manage his rigorous schedule.   It makes the most sense, in my opinion.  

I have an anecdote about a gift he brought one year, too.  I have lived most of my life in snowy country and, when I had to move to a balmy clime for a while, I found myself dealy missing the snow. So, on a whim,  I asked Santa, in my mind, on Christmas Eve, for snow.   The next morning I woke up to *hail on the ground!*  I lived there for 9 years and the only time it hailed at my house was that Christmas morning.   I ran out and picked some up in my hands and lifted it to my face to feel the cold bite and i could smell it and *it smelled just like snow!*     And then I knew for sure that Santa had brought it!   :D",arootytoottoot,1640474844
4237,CasualConversation,Languages are wild,"My native language isn't English, but I know English better having been raised in the US. I was listening to a song in my native language and to me the singer was singing sooo fast (like the lyrics were fast), so I played it out loud for my friend, and she said that it sounded as if she was singing a normal speed. 

Thinking about it, I'm reminded of my linguistics class where we talked about how some languages are capable of packing an insane amount of information into smaller units than other languages. For example, in English, ""name"" means the thing someone or something is called by. If you wanted to say ""her name"", you added another word. But some languages, like my native language, will just add an ending onto name that says it's someone's name, and it's much more fluid and faster than having a separate pronoun. That example is a small one, but going back to the song I played... To me, she was talking super fast because she was saying a lot of information that I was mentally translating into English. The translation was a lot more words than she was saying. It was like my brain somehow correlated ""lots of information"" with ""talking fast"", so although she was singing a perfectly normal speed, my brain had me convinced she was Eminem in Rap God.

4239,CasualConversation,I'm pretty proud of the dynamic of my kids friends that were over for Christmas.,"We hosted Christmas at our house yesterday, and it was loud and crazy..but in a good way. One thing I couldn't help but notice is specifically *who* was over. I'm a white guy, mid 40s pretty plain dude. Wife is the same. We've always been the house that our kids' friends spent time at. In fact we've actually let a handful of them pretty much live here for weeks at a time if they needed because their own home situation wasn't great. A lot of those friends throughout the years ""don't look like me"", or my kids.  Anyway, we had 12 total people over, about half of them was family and the other half were friends of the kids. My youngest son had his 2 best friends over. One is black, and one is Mexican. My daughter had her roomate, and her SO over. Both of them are trans, and use he/him type pronouns. Also over was my MIL's husband, he's about as much of a racist redneck type of a guy out there. We made sure everyone had gifts to open, food to eat and just a great time.  Overall it was a wonderful Christmas, that I was happy I could host!  I'm really happy that we seem to be raising our kids to love everyone, especially during this time of the year.",Bmc00,1640474278

4259,CasualConversation,Is it normal to feel bad about making good money?,"Is it normal to feel bad about making good money?

Context: I am 24 living in Eastern Europe. I have always been against billionares, exploitation, capitalism, the bunch. I literally have ""Eat the Rich"" tattooed across my belly.

I also make an extreme amount of money. I am a software developer for an US company, and according to the latest numbers I am in the top 0.02% earners in my country.

But with all this, I feel like I cannot truly enjoy it. My work does not cause anyone harm, I pay all my taxes, I have never exploited anyone but the companies I worked for, and the projects I have worked on have only been objectively useful to others. 

The problem is, I feel like I was not meant to be rich. I used to love the frugal lifestyle, and all of my friends still live that life.  At this point hanging out with them I always ""hide"" my money even though they know I earn well. I only take a bit of cash with me when I go out, I only wear trifted clothes, I drive a cheap car. If you saw me on the street, you'd think I'm a broke college kid. But once in a while, I hear myself saying ""come on man, it's just $200"" like an out of touch boomer. Because of this stupid income contrast, I feel like I am drifting away from my friends because there's always this elephant in the room and conversation always gets to my job. I am suddenly the ""rich guy"" and I hate it so much.

Don't get me wrong, I love the safety I have. I save 85% of my money and should be fine to live for about 2 years if I lose my ability to work. But despite this, I just get this feeling that I'm turning into someone I used to hate. I feel guilty that I am safe from poverty and my friends are not. I do not want to make new ""richer"" friends.

i laughed it off and quickly corrected myself but i’m having so many anxiety attacks over whether he’s judging me or assuming things about me and the other teacher  —  and especially worried whether he told the other teacher about my slip up.

So has anyone else here had a friend but for some reason you cannot get me into the friendship? Like there is NO apparent reason why you shouldn’t like this person but you just don’t? 

For example: I’ve had this on/off friendship with girl for 10 years! We are 24. We’ve had our issues but always became friends again. The thing is she loves me more than I love her. It’s awful but my heart chakra (if you believe that stuff) has been closed off from her from the start. Not to sound silly but when I feel this way it’s usually my soul literally telling me that something isn’t right (I learned this the hard way). The issue is this person seems to love and admire me so much. She has issues with being immature and impulsive. She has has habit of blocking me anytime we get an argument. She always comes back and gives a sincere apology but I still “off” about her. Like I’m not seeing something about her. 

Anyway randomly out the blue the moon the other day I just felt this strong urge to express to her that I didn’t trust her because of her behavior sometimes and the instability of our friendship! We were in great place but for some reason I just didn’t feel right about her. She didn’t react well to this even though I told her I wanted us to get better. Who wouldn’t want a friend who adores them?! It’s like I didn’t like how much she liked me. If that makes sense? It’s weird. I cannot for the life of me figure why I don’t like her. She’s pretty pleasant and fun in general.

4286,CasualConversation,I Published My First Children’s Book,"I’ve always dreamt of having my work published and being able to hold it in my hands. In November, with the help of my graphic designer partner, I published my first book on Amazon KDP. 

The title is called ‘Sadie Squirrel and The Dragon Festival’ and it follows a young squirrel as she guides a lost creature through the forest to the festival. The idea is entirely unique and I’m so proud of it. Sure, there are things I’d change if I do it again, but I’m taking that into the future books to make the process even better going forward. 

I don’t want to spam it here because that’s just not a nice move. I realise it’s the Christmas period and people are tight for money, so buying a strangers book may not be top of your list. If you’d like to read it and give me a review, I’d appreciate it because the feedback will help improve all future work.

An hour later, I saw her with her two friends in the bathroom. Passed out and foaming at the mouth. 

A white girl was trying to explain that the girl needed to be on her side, or she could drown from vomiting. 

The two girls with her didn’t really understand English, so they brushed off the white girl.

I got on my knees in this very wet bathroom and put the girl on her side. She was unresponsive and foaming at the mouth. 

Staff came and I said she needed to go to the hospital. She clearly had alcohol poisoning. 

It took 6 girls to carry her to the elevator. She was small but heavy. Unconscious people are heavy. 

Did everything I could to carry her downstairs. The girl was only 17, her friends also 17. Barely older than my 16 year old students. She was partially responsive. She was scared and in and out of consciousness. 

She started crying, said she didn’t want to die. I told her she would be okay. Told her to stay awake. She was going to get help.

I set some very normal goals to achieve in my life but with my personal situation, it’s not as easy as it usually is to be achieved. It just takes me a little more effort, time, energy, and patience than others to acheiev it. But when things get a little overwhelming, that’s where the lonely feeling hits and I try to break out of it.

Remember to cherish your time with loved ones today. Although please don’t forget to keep in mind 2 groups of people while you celebrate! The first and most important group are those less fortunate.

Second and only a little less important group, to keep in mind today are those who have to keep your world running behind the scenes today in usually the most thankless of professions who have given up family today so that you have the freedom to celebrate, or ensuring your electricity is on and water is running, making the sick well or driving goods to your local grocery store (and the many more professions I’m forgetting or don’t even realize exist).

No. What Santa does is exploit quantum uncertainty to visit multiple houses at once, in batches of several thousand or more.

The night was going amazing we were all having fun but then another guy tried to approach her (she rejected him) but I got so pissed and wanted to beat him up (I am a very calm and contained person I always avoid fights) but I got so pissed my friend took me out to cool down. I broke down and started crying because it was really hard for me to see her because I could not process our breakup in the army so I wasn't really over her. Anyway I went back inside and talked with her told her I love her, that I miss her that what we had was really special and that her thought alone was the only thing that kept me going during my training (special forces btw). The response I got was just so blank she said that it's just not possible for us to be together (which is true) and she seemed so unmoved. I broke down again she hugged me told me she loves me but we can't be together and then the night went on. I know she is right I know she didn't want to show feelings because she had just gotten over me and managed to move on.

I know it is not well structured but that's about it. I just can't stop thinking about her and I think I expected a different reaction from her that's pretty much it idk I just wanted to say it.

4331,CasualConversation,Today I (hopefully) saved a tiny spider's life.,"For the context, I'm 28, a guy, and have always been afraid of spiders. Like, fast breathing, chest tightening if even a tiniest one moved in my vicinity kind of scared.  


But since some time, I have been trying to learn not to fear them. I sometimes got close to take a picture, or tried to supress my reflexes to kill them, instead just leaving them be and letting them escape. Today, I was grabbing a leash for my dog, and I saw a tiny spider hanging out on it. It was like, maybe the size of your smallest fingernail, if not smaller. My first reflex was to at least smack it away, but I did something else instead.  


I grabbed a small piece of paper, carefully let the tiny guy climb on it, and left it outside. However, after a minute or so, it occurred to me that it's -5C outside (23 degrees F), and I dropped him into some snow. So I went back, and here it was, still roughly in the same area. It was moving around, but very slowly. I did the same thing as before - scooped the guy on some paper, and this time, I dropped him somewhere near the cupboard. He immediately started to move faster, and crawled under the cupboard.

I know, a lot of users complain that Reddit is toxic. But it's not true. Reddit is not toxic, some poeple in it are, just as in real life you have certain family members you avoid during ocassions. Isn't that how family is supposed to work?

I made friends I never knew I had. I shared a good laugh with many of them. Cried a few tears of joy at r/MadeMeSmile. Wished I could meet some of them in real life.

It's good.
A bit strange though. It feels like a darker Amelie.
Even though it's supposed to be Black Comedy, it feels like a Horror movie at times due to the way that the male lead, Yun-Ju treats dogs.
I saw a lot of mysef in the female lead Hyun-Nam.
The opening scene of her on the train with the Jazz music playing felt like a scene from one of my own stories.

We weren't poor, but there definitely was no money for extravagant Christmas presents. 

So my mom, trying her best, gifted us with a pair of underwear and a bag of sweets. However my brother and I were such smartass brat kids, we were so disappointed and we basically threw it back in her face and made fun of it.

Looking back I can't believe what c*nts we both were and if I were to teleport back to that time, I would have punched myself square in the face for being so disrespectful. My mom were trying her best on a tight budget to at least give us something to open on Christmas. 

Every year on Christmas I think back to this time and I think of how heartbroken my mom must have been. Not only did she provide for us in every other way, she was trying her best.

I have definitely grown wiser now (I am now 27 years old and this happened about 10-15 years ago), and Christmas now definitely doesn't mean gifts to me anymore, it means spending time with your loved ones and enjoying the Festive time.

My masters degree in mathematics was suppose to take me 2 years to complete. But now I have an additional year as I had to extend my degree because it was so difficult to keep up with it online. I couldn’t even attend one class on campus because of the pandemic. I still have 3 subjects + internship to do before I can get my degree. 

My dad seems disappointed in me for not joining the family business. My cousin on the other hand has finished his bachelors and joined the family business and looks quite well settled into it. I had the opportunity to join the business before my masters and I did try it out but I felt miserable everyday because the work was quite mundane. I did quite well in my diploma in mathematics and I got an opportunity to study my masters, hence I left my family business. 

I don’t see myself settling in the country of my family business as opportunities for the young is quite dull, plus social life is non-existent hence me leaving. 

But sometimes for a 27 year old I feel like I accomplished nothing and am being left behind. I don’t have my masters yet. I don’t have a job. I don’t hold any assets like a house. I don’t have a partner who I see a future with. Nothing. My relatives also taunt me about this sometimes.

I can smell my grandmothers cooking in the air, It was always ham, stuffed cabbage(halupki), perogi, halushki… the most amazing mashed potatoes.. us kids would run in and out while she was busily moving about the kitchen, her, my mother, and my aunts. We would get scolded for being in the way, but my grandmother made some time for us kids, she always tried, it may have been just a few moments of acknowledgment-  because she was so busy preparing, but, She always made a point to take time out of the chaos of cooking.. even when she was inundated with all the tasks required to feed a pre-contraceptive, baby boomer, rabbit-like family, just for us kids to “have a taste” of what was to come later in the day..  she made it happen, and it was marvelous. i miss that woman, she would have tried to feed me when she was on her deathbed if only i would have asked.



My grandparents grew up in the 30’s and 40’s, had thier kids in the 50’s and into the 60’s… and then celebrated, and more importantly to me, spoiled their grandchildren in the 70’s and 80’s…  my family made such a big deal at the time, about Santa, and Christmas, and caring for family and friends during the holidays, it was ingrained in me growing up, something i could look forward to every year. Now all my uncles and aunts, and my dozens of cousins, instead of getting together as a family have gone about their lives, gone separate ways, which i guess is to be expected.

My french teacher is on vacation right now, I'm trying to learn French because I think it's a cool language and can open up some great learning opportunities.

I have asked some of my french buddies about questions before and they kind of was mean and teased me about some stuff so I don't feel like asking them anymore about stuff.

However, while over hearing I keep hearing about this ""Sacred Blue"" color, I keep trying to see online what color is sacred to France or if it's a part of a flag or a society or their nomenclature. I'm very versed in linguistics and talking and giving speeches I have no idea why this one is so hard.

Anyone know of a sacred blue 🔵 color that these french people keep talking about?

Also if you guys have the answer it would help with my studies like..

1. Why is it sacred?

2. How long ago does this blue color date back?

3. We have so many exotic blue colors in USA too like Laguna Seca Blue (used on the famous BMW) But that's German so idk if any french will understand that also Azure Blue, Teal, Cyan etc etc 

4. Any rituals or things I should know about?

5. If any at all, is it practiced today?

6. What Is the Hex color for this code, can I buy it as paint?

4410,CasualConversation,I am slowly improving,"Sorry if this is in the wrong flair, this is my first time posting here.

I was raised in a Mexican household, but my father (who is bilingual) only spoke to us in English. As a result, my brother and I only know English and a little bit of Spanish. This makes it harder for me to speak to my mother and my relatives in Mexico who only know Spanish.

Anyway, tonight I had a conversation with my grandmother. Usually, I would say hi to her, ask how she has been, and tell her I love her and pass the phone back to my dad. However, today we spent at least an hour talking to each other and she even pointed out that my Spanish has gotten better. Yeah, I still made moments where I asked my dad to translate a word from English to Spanish, but I still held a pretty good and long conversation with her. The only person I am able to do that with is my mother, so this was a pleasant surprise.

I am just going to continue improving my Spanish skills and hopefully I am able to hold a conversation without asking for a translation of a word every five minutes. 

That's my epic backstory folks. I hope you have a great night and a wonderful Christmas!",AceTheNotSoGreat,1640407815

The day I took a holy sh*t: Freshman year of college living in the dorms. A lot of girls would listen to music while they showered… The toilets were also in the same bathroom. One day I had a brown snake playing peekaboo with my booty hole, so I ran to the bathroom. Made it to the first stall I could and plopped down. As I’m clearing my bowels, I hear some heavenly music playing. And by heavenly, I mean a girl was taking a shower and blaring gospel music. So, like any sane person would do, I videoed my face while I took a sh*t with the music playing. I was so proud because that was the day I took a holy sh*t. I have the video still to this day.


When I was a kid (think maybe 5-6 y/o) I really liked to collect “flower vases” that you could buy from the tourist traps on vacations. Here recently I cleaned out my closet and found my collection of flower vases that my parents had bought me and let me put little flowers in. Over a decade later, I realized my parents had let their innocent child create a huge collection of shot glasses…


I was so quiet in first grade my teacher sent me to speech therapy because she thought I couldn’t speak. After going for awhile, I found out I got to visit the treasure box and get free candy. From then on I refused to say anything in class because I knew it meant free candy and time out of class where I had to do the boring work.

4433,CasualConversation,This made me cry on christmas eve,"I spent christmas eve alone and I already feared that day. Since one year I go to a liquor store/bakery around the corner, like 2-3 times per week. They got a little table in front of the store where me and my dog sit around then, drinking a beer, reading newspaper, chatting to people passing by, sometimes others join me on the table. I like going there and know the people working there of course. A few days ago I went to the store and the woman who works there invited me to come on christmas eve for some drinks outside at the table. It's pretty obvious I'm a lonely person, I always go there alone and also the woman once caught me crying in a washing saloon around the corner, where I told her I feel lonely.
So it made me really happy she invited me you know?

 I got super excited, organized 2 bottles of mulled wine and a bottle of rum, christmas bread, chocolates and I made a christmas card for the guy who works there, Paddy, with a photo of my dog on the cover, because he always plays with my dog. I also packed a little water heater so that we could heat up the mulled wine.

So yesterday evening I went there with all my stuff and my heart felt very heavy so I was looking forward to have some company and drink a bit. I arrived at the shop and Paddy was working and I asked him which plug I could use for the water heater because I brought mulled wine for us all. He just answered: ""Ah no, sorry, that's not possible, we don't have a serving license."" That was it. 

All I could answer was:""Oh, ok."" Then I left the store and ran away. It was like a kick in my stomach. I threw away the card I made for him and threw all the candy on the street and when I entered my place I just broke down and cried and cried and cried. 

I wonder if these people have a tiny little bit of empathy or charity left in them. I mean come on, if a lonely person comes to your fucking store on christmas eve with a big bag full of things for everyone, isn't it more than obvious that she is lonely as fuck? Why don't you just help her heating up the stupid wine? He could have easily brought the heater into the back kitchen and heat it up there, it wouldn't have been the tiniest problem. Also the answer with the missing serving license is just crap. I didn't ask him to sell the wine, it was just for our private little christmas get-together. Plus, it was fuckin christmas eve, no authorities are running through the streets, checking if you got a license for anything. 

I don't know man but this made me so sad. This all made me feel miserable and humiliated and I will never go there again.",KaspersLunita,1640403128

I was up all day getting things ready since we hosted the dinner at my house. I woke up early and went out to do errands to get things ready for tonight. I spent a few hours out and when I got back home the deal was that my wife was going to make the main entree. I got home and nothing was ready and instead she left with her mom to Ulta. 2 and half hours before dinner was supposed to be. I ended up doing everything. I cleaned the house, I cooked the food and I even made the desserts. By the time I was done I was burned out and mad because by the time she got back I was pretty much done, pissed and tired. She ended up drinking all night and I guess everyone had a good time except me. I was just annoyed. My older brother was supposed to bring drinks and paper plates but he was the last one to show up. Showed up 2 and half hours late. I don't really want to talk to anyone especially my wife but idk. I really think I'm the problem. The whole deal was that everything was going to be cooked with plenty of time so we didn't have to rush or be tired or get hot since every time we make food for a big dinner my house gets extremely hot and it ended up in me doing everything while my wife and her mom went out shopping.

I did not have an awkward childhood stage, and I even had a guy say he liked me.

Post puberty I got a bunch of acne and gained some weight in my face that I can't lose (seems to be due to bad genetic luck). My hair got darker and thicker, and I just got uglier.

4476,CasualConversation,"It's my 19th birthday today, I've gradually accepted it.","It's weirdly okay. I awaited the days leading up to it freaking out. My stomach in knots, a poor appetite, fleeting suicidal thoughts, trembling, constantly crying, basically in denial again. Still, I made it to today. Inevitably older.

It hurts so much when I think about how I wasted my teenage years because I was homeschooled. Looking back on the past few years, most of my time was spent pacing around the house daydreaming to music and struggling severely with online school. All of a sudden at 18 I was labeled an adult, yet I didn't get properly experience being a teen kid. Having friend(s), and sustaining a hobby/being involved in extracurriculars, going to dances/sleepovers/ concerts/parties, starting their first real job, involved in their first relationship, etc.
Meanwhile I've mostly been inside until only recently when I started taking walks, really only have my older sister and parents to speak to as I haven't socialized, unable to stick to anything. 

What's even more embarrassing is that I should've graduated high school this year. Instead, like an utter failure, I have only finished the 10th grade a few months ago due to being trapped in a horrible expensive online program known for setting students back. So burnt out, I haven't done anything since. 
But, I'll cut the venting short and save it for another subreddit.

I guess what I'm saying is that I feel stunted, like I'm still a little kid, terrified of aging, somewhat hopeless. 
Now that the day is here I'm just around, forcing myself to be in the moment. Like all the other birthdays, my family got takeout to eat together, a birthday cake that'll be lit with candles and cut soon, and hopefully some hugs, love, and a gift for me.

4482,CasualConversation,Am I an asshole for not enjoying christmas?," This is how it usually goes for me:

1. Go to a dinner with my family, where 99% of conversations involve things I don’t understand or stories of people that I don’t and will never know. I basically have to stay put and shut my brain off, because any attempt to leave the table or just pull out my phone will end with me being told to socialize about things that I genuinely could not give less of a fuck about.

2. I have to hug my family. This is probably just me being a bitch, but hugging my family rings hollow. I cant hug my family as if I actually love them,?because deep down, we just kind of tolerate each other. My sisters never had the best relationship, and one of them moved away so we don’t see her that often anymore. The sister that hasn’t yet moved away just throws into everyone’s face how “I do all the work and you do nothing but be useless”, she does that with me and my dad, and her fair share of clashes with my mom. My dad is never afraid to get mad over trivial bullshit, compare me with other children or call me useless for no good reason. He isn’t physically abusive at all, but when he wants, he is very verbally abusive with basically everyone. Even my mother, who I’d say is BY FAR the one that I get along the best with, often becomes completely toxic when the topic of school is brought up, as she apparently values me having good grades WAAAAY above my mental health. My sisters are basically Einstein compared to me, so I guess she just doesn’t know what to do with a kid that just doesn’t understand what he has to do. Everyone hates everyone in one way or another, so hugging each other as if nothing was wrong just feels unearned, because we are not what I would call a loving family. I wouldn’t say we are like the worst family in existence, but we are absolutely not the peak of humanity.

3. Last (and kinda least), presents. The only good thing I have to look forward to after the shit-fest is the presents. Problem is, its always clothes clothes clothes. They never switch it up at all. And sure, I’m being an ungrateful asshole, but if you ask me, a person that has trouble closing a drawer from the SHEER AMOUNT OF SHIRTS I HAVE, I *think* I’m justified in being disappointed every time I open a bag to find my 900th shirt inside. They could gift me a singular slice of cheese, and I would honestly find way more value in that than I would in a 80$ shirt. Instead of just wasting their money on things that they know I wont like (because they KNOW I dont care about clothes), why dont they just give me money and let me buy my OWN present? I get the sentiment and all, but its honestly just a waste of money if you buy me something that I will never use. Im trying to save both sides here, im begging you, please give me something that isn’t clothing of any kind.

Sorry for the long rant. Its completely possible that I’m just being an asshole. Does anyone else feel like this with christmas?",Memorableman,1640393059

4484,CasualConversation,Why is Facebook repeatedly restricting my account?,"I apologize if this is in the wrong spot / subreddit, but I am beyond confused about what's going on.

Since November 3rd, I've been getting ""Your account will be restricted for at least 90 days"" due to ""repeatedly sharing false information."" The thing is, I hardly share anything. When I do, it's inspiring stuff (motivation and such), family-friendly memes, cooking recipes, etc. I never even share news stories. It gives me a ""See Why"" button, and shows me the date of something I posted, but not the actual post itself. When going through my profile, I don't see anything that was labeled as false. I'm only still on there because my friends and family tell me that my posts inspire them to stay strong, to keep going a little longer, giving them that reminder that someone cares and that they are capable of great things. So it's all positive stuff.

But with this CONSTANT ""account restricted"" nonsense, it makes me want to just delete my account and never look back, which I'm honestly considering, but at the same time, I don't want to feel like I'm leaving my family and friends behind. I have a motivational page with 1,000+ followers, some of which have messaged the page personally asking for advice, thanking me for talking with them, saying I really helped them, etc. I don't want to leave them behind. It doesn't feel fair to them.

So I'm just genuinely curious as to what's going on, because I know that this exists for people who DO share false information, but I am not one of those people. Just genuinely confused, and not willing to go through the extensive process of the Overview Board or whatever.

4494,CasualConversation,Enjoyment of sad movie,"Hey there.

I  really don't know the exact reason, but for some reason I love one really sad movie. I don't why sadness in this movies touches me so hard. Or why would anyone even enjoy a sad movie. I doesn't really makes sense, we should enjoy happy movies, not sad ones. But at the end of the day, this is the kind of film that is hard to stop thinking about.

The movie tells a story about a man trapped in a dogs body. (That's really   all I can tell without spoiling too much, but it should be enough.) To me, it's a movie about accepting who you are. Some things in life are unchangable. You just have to live with some facts. Maybe you are intelligent person, stuck in mentally challenged persons body. Or maybe you are person with working legs, stuck in a wheelchair persons body. Or even a sighted person, stuck in blind mans body. Simply put, you have something in yourself, that has been really difficult to accept as it is. Well, if you feel that way, this movie is definitely for you.

It's called **Fluke**. The movie was made in 1995 and directed by **Carlo Carlei**. The movie starrs **Matthew Modine**, **Nancy Travis**, **Max Pomeranc**, **Eric Stoltz** and **Samuel L. Jackson**. Other minor roles are played by **Collin Wilcox-Paxton, Ron Perlman**, **Jon Polito** and **Bill Cobbs**. The composer of this movie is **Carlo Siliotto**, who did a really good job. The music in this movie is very beautiful and touching.

Even though this movie was originally marketed as familiy-friendly, I would probably recommend it for 16 years or older.

4499,CasualConversation,Is it weird that I love old tech so much despite being young?,"I'm only 25 but I love old technology so much. Cassettes, VHS tapes, old stereos, floppy disks, CDs, you name it. Despite being born in the late 90s, I really find more solace in old technology than the new, modern technologies. Maybe because they're different, maybe because being into it makes me feel like a hipster lol, maybe it's the simplicity of it or just the fact that I don't enjoy life in the present so I'm looking for a way to mentally ""teleport"" to old times, so old that I haven't even experienced them myself. It's really weird because no one I know feels the same way I do. 

For instance, I still use CDs regularly, and I've kept an older PC in the house just because it has an optical drive and I can play CDs on it. I have Windows 3.11 for Workgroups installed in Virtualbox and I find myself toying with it regularly. I just love the vibe it gives me, sometimes I just start it up so I can play Solitaire, doodle some sketch in Paint or even browse older websites on Netscape. I cannot explain exactly why I feel like this, it just makes me feel like I've escaped in a different world. Modern technology doesn't make me feel that way.

However, I've just graduated from university and her only a year into medicine school, I realised that there are so many uncertainties and it would be a long time before we can truly be together. 
I called it off and explained everything to her, she was understanding but was extremely hurt so I told her I'd be there with her and still flak to her everyday until she moves on. I also encouraged her to go on dates once she's fully healed.

Now fastforward 5 months, she used all 5 of those months to get over me, accepting the reality while I've secretly been falling more and more for her. I guess it was also my fault that I couldn't keep my distance.

Now she's just started dating someone and from what I've gathered she's in a good place, I'm truly happy for her that she was able to move past this but at the same time, incredibly devastated that I won't be the person she talks to about the small things that happen everyday, or the one to say good morning/night anymore.

I'm currently on a break from talking to her because seeing her face or hearing her voice will break me.

As you know, with the holidays around the corner, covid will most likely be spreading like wildfire. Me and my girlfriend are fully vaccinated and wear our masks everywhere — we are beyond cautious. However, my girlfriend went to her dads yesterday for a couple of hours (keep in mind, her dad was with his girlfriend the day before yesterday and they went to a Christmas party). Both her dad and his girlfriend just recently got the booster. Yet, she called him today and said she tested positive for covid. My girlfriend literally just saw him yesterday. Granted, he just got tested today and was negative but it’s only been two days since he saw his girlfriend so I’m not sure that’s accurate. My girlfriend is coming to see me on the 26th. Do you think she should come still or stay home? I live in a completely other state so I bought her a plane ticket, btw.

I should also preface that my parents are not vaccinated and my brother (who is also not vaccinated) lives with us as of right now. He goes EVERYWHERE without a mask, his kids come over, my mom just went to a Christmas get together, and she just saw my other brother who also never wears a mask anywhere and isn’t vaccinated. Actually, my mom had to babysit my niece for 2 weeks as a little girl in her daycare was positive for covid, so they had to shut it down. 

Overall I just don’t know what my girlfriend should do. Of course I really want to see her, I’m just very very aggravated. My mom and her mom both said it’s up to my girlfriend and if she’s comfortable or not to come. Advice?!",sleepyyvirgo,1640383455

4519,CasualConversation,Be at your best to those you love,"Here’s a little thought experiment. 

Think of the person you admire the most. The Dalai Lama? The Pope? Tom Cruise? Oprah Winfrey? Tucker Carlson? Tom Brady? Mo Salah? Jamie Oliver? Bill Gates? Maya Angelou? Emma the Yellow Wiggle?

What if you met them?

You would naturally be at your absolute best, right? You would be polite and courteous. You would be considerate and tactful. You would be attentive and receptive. You wouldn't interrupt them when they are talking.

Now, imagine if they offended you, intentionally or otherwise.

What if the Dalai Lama spilled coffee on you? What if the Pope borrowed your bicycle and left it at a bus station? What if Tom Cruise borrowed $50 from you and forgot about it? What if Tom Brady yelled at you? What if Mo Salah forgot your birthday? 

What if Bill Gates seemingly likes your friend better than you? What if you heard that Maya Angelou was badmouthing you to family members? What if Jamie Oliver refuses to cook for your birthday after promising he would? What if Emma Watkins refuses to lend you her Wiggles outfit?

How would you react? Would you yell at them? Give them the silent treatment? Plot some form of revenge? 

You wouldn’t, right? They are your idols, so you would still treat them with great consideration and respect. You would probably talk to them about it. You would still be polite and courteous. You wouldn't be confrontational.  You will express your discomfort. You will seek to resolve the issue amicably.

Now, think of your loved ones. They are far more important to you than these icons are. But would you treat them with the same level of kindness and respect? If you are, then please stop reading – you’re already a star. If you aren’t, you are taking your loved ones for granted.

The people you love deserve the best version of you. You must always be at your most kind, most considerate, most polite and most loving with them. 

Please don’t hide your lack of kindness behind flawed concepts like brothers always fight, lovers always quarrel, friends always hurt each other, etc. Yes, these things happen. But that’s because you’re taking them for granted.

Be the best version of yourself with the people you love. Be at your kindest with the people you love. If they don’t reciprocate immediately, that’s fine. Just do your part.

But I’ll tell you a secret. Most people, especially those who love you, will eventually match your vibe.

I’m much more emotionally vulnerable and close with my friends than I am with my family. I’ve talked with them about both the good and bad and it has felt nice and safe while I just don’t feel the same doing with my family.

Only as I grew older did I realize that Santa was being merciful. After all, a hundred years earlier, in colder climates, coal wasn't as useless as I might think; perhaps the bad children wouldn't get toys and chocolate, but at least they'd be warm for a while.

It started with me just nonchalantly, one day mentioning that I didn't know Albert Einstein was a real person and let it stew with them for a couple of days. Until finally a few days they were like, ""I can't believe you didn't think he was real"" and I could finally give the punchline...""I thought he was just a theoretical physicist"" 🤣

I didn't get the normal response from them but didn't think anything else about it until last night. I went to a family Christmas with my ex-wife(baby mama[it's complicated, but we all get along great]) to her family's gift exchange. I get a gift from my former mother-in-law and open it up. It a nice framed picture of Einstein with a little inspiration quote, that I'm pretty sure he never actually said. My first thought was this was a strange gift for me.

As soon. As I open it, my former MIL(who has this spin tingling sharp laugh) begins laughing, and shouts ""I can't believe you didn't know he wasn't real!"" Then the rest of the family starts following suit and are laughing with her as well.

He’s a huge MCU fanboy so of course he was super hyped for the new Spider-Man movie, and so was I. My thoughts were I loved the movie, it lived up to the hype and was great, but it’s not in my top 5 let alone being my favorite SM movie (that belongs to spider-verse). My friend however, has it as his favorite movie and he can’t seem to wrap his head around that I like into the spider-verse more, saying like “I don’t understand how NWH isn’t your favorite SM movie”. He also believes that the scene when the three spider men went into the fight together and did their classic stuff is the best SM scene ever, beating the “Leap of faith” and he refuses to believe otherwise.

It hurts how much he cries when coming to me, it's like he doesn't want me at all and like he hates me, he doesn't cry at all when it time for him to leave here, he's happy af to see momma and then at that point it's fuck me really.

4582,CasualConversation,Do you whistle in public,I find that sometimes when walking down the sidewalk my mind wanders and I begin whistling songs. Sometimes I'm unaware that I'm doing it and people are giving me strange looks. I also do this when walking my dog at the local park when he wanders off. Since the field is large my whistle is extremely loud and startling. Don't worry I don't use my fingers with the pandemic going on. My fingerless whistle is 110 db.,Worldly-Yoghurt-5168,1640363266
4583,CasualConversation,Christmas miracle! My mom’s fiancée fixed my car.,"I don’t really have anyone to tell but I really wanted to share this. I have a car that I bought off the street just before the pandemic for $1,000. it’s a 2008 car with well over 170,000 miles on it but it runs far enough to do exactly what I need it to and it be to having the car payment I used to have. The car market is so out of control that I couldn’t possibly afford a new car right now and my office is talking about going back into the office instead of working remotely so it has been a very big source of stress for me. My brake lights were out and the engine sounded terrible. I asked a neighbor to fix it, but he started giving me a run around and it didn’t take me long to figure out that I was being scammed. He was telling me the engine was going to “blow” at any moment. In reality, he was trying to pawn off the car onto another neighbor that he was friends with by telling me it was a lost cause.

I waited a little over a month for my mother to come home from her trip with her fiancé and he took a look at it. It just turned out that the car needed a little bit more oil (definitely my fault, I know how to check that) but the brake lights were malfunctioning due to a switch corroding. He replaced it in one hour and I have a car again.

It’s an old car. It makes a lot of wind noise. It has a CD player that doesn’t work. It’s not much, but it’s mine and I love it.",ArchiveSQ,1640363199
4584,CasualConversation,"I love my job at the aquarium, even if the pay is bad","Hi guys, I just made a post on r/advice because I was considering leaving my job at the aquarium for a job at a furniture store that would've paid me 3X more.

I've done years of retail work before this, so I know that I wouldn't enjoy working at the furniture store.

I realized that it doesn't matter how much money you have if you're miserable every day at your job.

I know I'm very lucky to be able to make this choice because I have my parents to fall back on and I don't have any children myself yet. So I'm very thankful that I'm able to work a low paying job that I enjoy instead of just taking a job for the money.

In the mean time, I'm going to keep searching for a job that I both enjoy and can live off of.

Has anyone else reading this ever faced a decision like this?

I'm curious to hear what choice you made and how it worked out.

I'm generally steadfast in maintaining hygiene but from some reason brushing teeth evades me, and I mostly only ever do it if I'm going out somewhere special or with someone special. Trying to fix it, yes, but that's besides the point. Despite this, I've always had what people consider ""perfect"" teeth, I've never had a cavity, never had to wear a brace, and the only remark my dentists ever gave me is that I should floss, but they too have sung praise for how healthy my teeth look.

Now, I know that tooth health is heavily affected by your oral ecosystem, and I suppose I should be grateful for that fact, otherwise I'd have certainly lost a pearl or more a long time ago. However I keep hearing stories about how people don't brush for long enough that gunk starts appearing on the teeth. I know what it's like to be depressed and lose all will of maintaining oneself, but what the hell?? How long do you have to go before that?

Enjoyed a lot in his company. I was in fact able to make some of his bullies and him friends through some effort..

We both did have some differences when we joined different high schools. But we were quick to settle it and I thought all was good..

Now we have joined good colleges in the same city and he even called me over to play some football at his place. We even had a good conversation about some memories from school and some of the mutual friends we both met in our respective colleges.. Just a week ago, one of my other friends joined his college and coincidentally they travel in the same public transport to go to college. I told my friend to take my name and initiate a conversation with him and possibly even become good friends. My friend supposedly did so and my ""best"" friend gave him a weird look and told him ""Let's not talk about that fucker, he can suck my d\*ck"". I am shattered really.. I was hopeful our differences from the past were all healed and I've told only nice things about him to our mutual friends and told them to become friends with him.

4611,CasualConversation,Opinions I Have Which Nobody Else Seems To Have,"This is a friendly part of Reddit they tell me, but I found this section doing a search for past posts regarding opinions one has that others seem to disagree with. Here are mine

* Dogs are not amazing. They don't belong in stores, I don't want to hear them barking when I'm home and daring to use my yard, I don't want them inside my house, and ones that repeatedly trespass into my yard uninvited despite my saying I don't want them here, ANYTHING I do to fix that problem should be totally legal. Owners of dogs that bark a lot should be subject to jail time for repeat offenses.

(2) The MeToo movement is a bunch of bologna. Say something WHEN an attack occurs, not 30 yrs later. Due process matters too, not ""believe all women.""

(3) If you as a woman wear a low cut tanktop with spaghetti straps and no bra and-or Daisy Dukes shorts, you have no right to complain if a guy checks you out a little bit. I'm NOT talking about LONG stares or especially verbally bothering you over and over, but a little staring or mild flirting--totally fair.

(3) Any photography in public which isn't upskirts is totally fair, including candids of your children. I especially find it ludicrous to complain about someone taking your photo in public when you have a dashcam videoing everything as you drive, or doorcams recording everyone at your doorstep. So what if it ends up online, too.

(4) Basketball, the 3 pointer should be eliminated. I absolutely despise Steph Curry and wish a 7 footer would knock him on his ass.

(5) You should have to prove you live on secluded rural roads or ""side streets"" in the city before you drive on them. People who chose to live there did so because they don't want a lot of traffic in front of their house, and shouldn't have to put up with it--yes, even though it's tax payer funded.

(6) You have no right to sunbathe 3"" from a pool and complain about getting wet from people using the pool.

(7) Most Internet censorship should be illegal.

(8) It should be the law that ads on TV and radio etc only occur, say, for 20 seconds every 20 minutes.. This thing of having 30 seconds of ads every 4 minutes is EXTREMELY excessive.

(9) Tools, no ""allen wrench"" screw heads AND Philips Head AND ""slotted"" screws. Pick one, yes ONE, and stick with it, for ALL screws.

(10) No forced automatic updates, by LAW. Once every 6 months is enough, and NOT while I'm in the middle of something, and I STILL better not get hacked ANYWAY.",shyguylh,1640353926

I make my left turn as I usually do, and as I straighten out I look up to see him somewhat turn then hits the curb and almost the light pole. 

Turns out, his strut and upper ball joint sheared from their mounting points as he was making the turn. Now I get the slalom bit didn’t help, and probably set things in motion.

4655,CasualConversation,I cut someone off from my life for the first time...,"Hello,

I liked talking to this friend, and we surely had some amazing conversations. However, he would say some offensive things to only gain a reaction out of me sometimes and it became a cycle of this -

1. We talk nicely, he is very sweet and considerate and is giving me the attention and everything I am asking for like listening to me and all.
2. He says things that are mean and then ends up saying other things, which are not the points he should use in an argument and just sabotages who I am as a person.
3. We take a pause, not talk for a few days, and then he texts again and we begin texting and this is a loop -1-2-3-1-2-3

I have been understanding from my part and there have been many times when I didn't mind what he said because of, ""He is just teasing, don't react."" mentality.

However, last week, I cut him off. Everywhere, from every social platform. He mailed me (no apologies for what he said or did and just two words- unblock me), and I didn't reply.

If I were who I was one year ago or even few months back, I would have replied to his email and reconsidered the friendship. We had an amazing time too, after all.

But for some reason, I could not reply to it and also, I feel like to end this thing would be the best thing. So yes, this is the first time I have cut someone off completely and I do feel a teeny tiny bit of regret because I wouldn't like it if someone would have done this to me. But also, I would have mailed them an understanding cogent apology and a request to unblock me.",zzifLA-zuzu,1640327852

Why it's a big deal to me: This album this song is on came out in 2003, I've owned it since then and listened to it many, many, many times. Elephant is one of my favorite White Stripes albums. Especially when I was younger, and even now, I've always been a freak about knowing the correct lyrics to songs.    
I would even be a little shit and correct my friends if they were singing something wrong.  I'd get so bummed if I bought a CD and the lyrics weren't in the cover booklet.

It seems theres just so many people becoming influencers or already influencers, especially because of tiktok. So I am wondering, how many people do you think make a living off it now and don't work the ""normal"" jobs? Not that it's a bad thing, just curious.

The idea of this virus ultimately infecting everyone and messing with everyone's brains is terrying to me. What I'm really scared of are all of the variants possibly making this virus unkillable. The way we're handling this pandemic makes me think that we're never gonna do what it takes to end it. 

I'm picturing a world were variants just get stronger and more infectious, and there's more of them. affecting people's brains so even if they survive it they end up blind or deaf or in comas and respirators, vaccines just can't keep up with variants, and this is our world now.

I've been considering cutting off our friendship for a while now. At first, I thought that I just had to work out some issues with myself, but... I mean he gets angry at me for random things, and really quickly, *especially* if I'm just talking about myself or my day. At first, I tried to just start listening better and learning to understand that his boundaries might be different than my own, but like... now it's gotten to the point where I can't even have a normal conversation with him without him freaking out about something random that I've said. Like I can't stress enough that the conversations will usually just be boring stuff about my day-to-day, like ""oh I saw a pigeon today"" or smth, then he'll freak out and be like ""oh my god I HATE pigeons, why would you bring that up?!?!"" and then go on and on about how I shouldn't have said that, when like... I've known him for 11 years and he never had a problem with pigeons before this month.

He also just flat-out forgot my birthday. And I guess it wouldn't be that weird, but we were literally talking about our birthdays a few days prior to mine, and he asked me the date then just forgot it anyway. I'm not very sentimental about these things, but on top of everything else I really feel like he sees me as a tool and not a friend.

Then there's the money... I barely have enough money to afford my apartment and utilities as-is. He'll spend other people's money on every single object that he sees- he claims to ""need"" them- and then once he has no more of other people's money to spend, he'll turn to me. I think it's because I live in an apartment and he lives with his parents... he thinks I'm rich, but I'm literally just saving as much money as I can and paying my bills instead of splurging on random objects that catch my fancy. I mean he just blew $300 of somebody else's money on a... specialty toy... and then immediately asked me for like a $60 thing immediately after saying that.

I'm a 21 year old and one A.R.K. I will always remember happened was one that someone else did for me. I was 9 years old and my family was on a vacation/baseball trip. Because my brother was playing in baseball games and most hotel rooms only have two beds my parents would take one bed, my brother would take the other and I would use spare blankets that we packed and two of the pillows from my brother's bed to make a blanket bed on the floor.

On this trip my brothers team wasn't seeded very high in the tournament because they won one and lost one in pool play. The lower seeded teams have to play earlier, don't ask me why that's just the way it goes. So we leave the hotel at about 7 A.M. and we go to the ball fields and we are gone playing baseball all day long. My brothers team actually did pretty well, made it to the quarter finals I think. We come back to the hotel hot, tired, and feeling really dusty. We walk into our room and maid service came into the room to clean and change sheets and towels and do what they are paid to do. But whoever did our room went above and beyond and to everyone's surprise not only did that person make both normal beds but remade my blanket bed and restacked the pillows as though it was one of the normal beds.

4698,CasualConversation,I feel like such a loser,"In High School, I was a bit of a Type A; I had straight As, did lots of activities, and did great on my standardized tests. As a result, I was able to attend one of the best colleges in the country. When I got there, I did a complete 180 though. After being a nerd at an all-boys school for 4 years, going to a co-ed school with partying and freedom definitely had me shift my priorities. I could care less about grades cause in my head I thought ""well I already made it to this school so I guess the work is done."" I failed multiple classes, was put on academic and disciplinary probation for cheating, and constantly dealt with relationship drama (a lot of it my own doing). When senior year rolled around, most of my friends were getting offers from top firms that paid well into the 6 figures while I barely had an internship under my belt. Even though firms were recruiting from my school and major, my low GPA and the whole cheating stain on my transcript made it impossible for me to get one of these jobs. I ended up taking a job with some random non-profit close to my home. The job didn't pay well and the work I was doing was not really fitting for someone with my skillset. I quit after two weeks and took a job reporting down in Miami. While I actually really like the job, the pay is less than my first job and I didn't know anyone in the area. I had to get a part time job to supplement my income but even that wasn't enough. I was forced to live with my grandma and couldn't afford to go out and meet people. After 2 months, I had to move back home and have secretly been working from NJ while I'm supposed to be in Miami. Most of my friends live together in the city and make around 4 times more than me. I don't even have a room at my mom's house and have to sleep on her couch. On top of all of that, my mom is emotionally abusive and I constantly have to hear about what a terrible son I am and about all the wrong I do all the time.

4703,CasualConversation,Is it child abuse to skip Christmas on certain years or only with certain children as a punishment?,"Mormon vloggers “8 passengers” have declared their 2 youngest children (8 and 10 yrs old) will not be getting presents this year. They will watch their 4 older siblings get visited from Santa but they will not get anything. The parents who’ve been accused of child abuse multiples times say the kids aren’t getting presents because of selfishness. 

Personally I don’t think a family that celebrates a commercial Christmas every year should withhold it as a punishment.
My main reason is Santa. Kids believe in Santa. if they don’t get presents for acting like normal kids I think it gets confusing when kids at their school who act like gremlins or bullies get on the nice list and they don’t.

The only time I can see this as acceptable is if the child is violent or hateful in an extreme way. We obviously don’t know the full context of what the “selfishness” entailed, but I believe making them watch their other siblings open presents when their siblings have probably acted the same way they did before their teens is a form of emotional abuse.",deathpactio124,1640307584

4762,CasualConversation,My ping-pong friend,"Three years ago i met a guy at a party and we had a nice talk and exchanged numbers. Since he lived in my area, I randomly asked him if he wanted to meet up to play ping-pong at the local park. Turns out he LOVES playing ping-pong and since that one time, we meet every few weeks to play and catch up. Either at the park or his place, he has got his own table. We never really do anything else because he has got a bit of social anxiety and I am not the most talkative person, so there are times when we both don't really feel like talking and just play.
Other times we have these really deep conversations while we just keep on playing on autopilot.
It's just so nice to have him as a friend and I am pretty sure we would have never became friends if we didn't have that ping-pong thing!

4766,CasualConversation,People are so beautiful,"Do you ever see pictures of strangers when they arent trying to look good according to societal standards? When a woman isn't trying to look thin with big eyes and clear skin? Or a guy isn't trying to look buff with a full head of hair and a dog beside him. Like a photo of them showing off their hobby or having fun with their friends or even making fun of themselves. I love those pictures. Sometimes stumble over them on reddit or other social media's and I'm just like ""whoa, that person is so beautiful."" You can just see their passion, their humor, their beauty. You know before they posted that picture they were comparing themselves to societal standards and criticizing themselves but posted it anyways cuz they wanted to share whatever it was they wanted to share, and that was more important than the buffiness of their muscles or the smoothness of their skin. Whenever I get a chance to see strangers (over the internet because screw leaving my house) being themselves and letting their personality and passions shine through it makes me so happy. It's like a reminder that the world is diverse and there's beauty in every corner of it. I wish societal standards weren't so advertised. I wish people wouldn't buy into them so much then expect and bully others into adhering to them too. The world is so big, there's so much passion, and humor and beauty everywhere! There's strong resilient mothers, hard working men in recovery making a better life for themselves; there's introverted cat girls knitting hats for their felines, old men with kind eyes helping a hopeless 20 y/o change their tire for the first time. People are so fuckhng beautiful! I wish we could see that advertised more on the internet. I wish we would encourage it, instead of conforming then bullying others to adhere to these ridiculous soulless standards. I want to see the light, the strength, the passion in your eyes. I want to see the uniqueness, the things that bring you joy and make your soul beautiful. I bet you are all so remarkably beautiful and interesting and strong. I hope as I continue to live in this giant diverse world I'll get more chances to see the unique beauty of people. I hope the world will also learn to see it and accept it as well.

I jumped out of bed, grabbed the gift mugs I got for the workers and ran outside. They had already gotten my trash and was moving onto the rest of the neighborhood, but one of the guys met me on the street. They all waved and said merry Christmas back to me and it was all good and done! So I thought!

A couple hours later, I hear a truck outside my house. I see a lone worker texting on his phone, looking back at my house every so often. Out of sight to me was a new lid for my trash bin, and when I realized he was there to replace it for me I stepped out and said thank you! Its had a hole in the side of the lid for the past couple years I've lived here, and I never bothered to ask them to replace it.

4802,CasualConversation,too late to switch,"I'm a freshman at Cal, who is currently a double CS and Pre-Business major. This first semester, I took Intro to CS (A-), Calc II (A), and Intro to BioE (A) as a breadth. Next semester, I will be taking Data Structures, Designing Information Devices and Systems I, Reading and Writing Part B, and Intro to Business.

However, the more I think about it, the less and less I want to apply to Haas (the business school). It's not because I'm lazy and don't want to do the application, I don't even think I want to do econ. I want to consider dropping the entire haas/econ portion of my major and replace it with something more stem focused like biology or math. I feel like business isn't really a tangible skill, and if I really did want to learn business I could always get an MBA later.

I also want to consider going on the premed track. I have never given medicine the full consideration that I should have, and I think I chose business as my primary major while applying just because it seemed easy. I'm really fascinated by all three major sciences and want to explore them all more, especially biology. My question is would it be too late to switch to premed by the start of sophomore year, because that is realistically the earliest time I could? If I do end up switching, I'll probably live in my frat house over the summer and take Intro to Chem with lab over the summer along with maybe Intro to Stats. Does anyone have any advice for me?

4817,CasualConversation,Just saw a really interesting episode of MASH,"When I was a kid I used to groan when MASH came on, I'd instantly change the channel to something more animated. Even though I've always loved sitcoms (Seinfeld &amp; King of Queens being favorites) MASH always felt a little too serious for me. However after months of Hulu recommending it to me I finally gave it a chance.

I know some of the ""twists"" of the show because of pop culture but I just watched an episode I found really interesting. It's just titled ""Hawkeye"" and it revolves around one of the leads getting into an accident and taking shelter with a Korean Family. What I find interesting is, the family doesn't speak English and Hawkeye can't communicate with them. So to stay awake during a concussion he just talks, filling in his backstory to a family that has no idea what he's saying. No other regulars of the series ever show up, and he has literally no one to work off. 

It's a really cool way to build a character, to make him more deeper than just a smart ass as he tries to keep his cool while facing his mortality. Even the fact that through non verbal ways the family and him bond was really well done. 

Would love to know if they're any shows you feel have an episode that is particularly strong or well done?",davaporboy,1640269018

4826,CasualConversation,My opinion abou The Matrix Resurrection. Don’t read if you haven’t watched it,"I am a huge fan of the matrix. My name is literally Thomas Anderson, but besides a coincidental name relation. The whole story of the movie resonates within me. It hits home about our everyday life, how we’re just cogs in the machine with the illusion of choice. I am even a fan of the Animatrix, which to my surprise very few people know of. 

It forced trinity to have more than a ""neo's love connection"" or ""the first lady"" of the matrix role. She was always a fierce go getter in the other movies with unparalleled drive. Neo, a man, being “the one” sole provider of being able to do cool matrix shit had to change imo because the brothers are are the Wachowski sisters now.  

The entire cast was mostly women, IO city was mostly women, the cherry on top was that awful rendition of rage against the machine at the end which sounded like a prepubescent boy performing (it was a woman band). They could’ve at least got a harder woman band to cover it like ‘In This Moment’. I love a good cover, like in Black Widow a woman covered teen spirit and it sounded great.

Great movie. Loved how they kept the universe going, its just obvious how now that the 2 brothers became sister it had a ""i am woman hear me roar vibe"" especially with trinity flying at the end. 

But just like how some of neos powers got put into agent smith i can see it being distributed during a ""power touch"" moment but if thats the case they should've elaborated with a moment of Trinity having a self realization during that starbucks fight scene

I feel like I have to site evidence of me not being a woman hater or anti-trans. But isn’t obvious when an agenda is being pushed? The Matrix, after all is about thinking for yourself and not being a lamb. It was a good watch. The ending was meh. But it was a great expansion on the universe.

Now for fun matrix facts: The character Switch in the first one was supposed to be a woman in the real world but a man in the matrix but they changed it and made her wear white instead. World Wasn’t ready I guess? 

The Wachowski’s wanted will smith to play Neo at first but he turned it down to do wild wild west.",chillinwithmypizza,1640265716
4827,CasualConversation,Being beautiful is a superpower,"I have a couple of beautiful friends (a man and a woman). They've both done quite a bit of modeling, they're like movie star good looking.

They live in a completely different world to the rest of us. When I hang out with them the way people treat them is mind boggling. When they speak, people listen immediately, people are intimidated with them. I've seen strangers become flustered and and trip over their words when meeting them. People treat them like gods who they daren't approach.

They are lovely people and a couple of my best friends. They have great personalities but are treated like a different species to some of my other equally funny and great friends who aren't as conventially attractive. It's a shame that evolution has produced this massive inequality.

I feel GREAT about this! Getting presents can be pretty anxiety inducing for me (I’m afraid the money will go to waste and I won’t use it enough or that my gift isn’t as good). I’m also cheap and get anxious when I’m spending money so buying stuff someone might or might not like is just scary. 

Now, I’ve been wanting a switch for months (I’ve been wanting it since it came out in 2019, but I’ve been seriously looking for one for the past few months).

The amount of cultural stereotypes and standards of beauty makes brown men the most desirable when it comes to dating. I'm not even desperately looking for love. But at times when something so beautiful happens in my life or when I see something beautiful, a part of my heart wants to share it with someone. And it hurts to not be able to find that person.

4833,CasualConversation,I want to thank my boyfriend's friends for helping us move in the best way possible.,"My boyfriend and I have very suddenly had to move homes, and it has been extremely stressful for us both. Between trying to find a new place in time and getting our stuff packed and moved (on top of us both working a full-time job) the whole ordeal has been really hard on us.

I have been having to work very long hours at my job due to us having a smaller team and this being the busiest time of the year, so I haven't been at home much and therefore I'm not around to help pack and move things to our storage unit. I have been handling pretty much everything else, like applying to rentals and scheduling cleanings and other administrative-type stuff, but my boyfriend has been doing the brunt of the physical work. I feel bad about this, but luckily, he has an amazing group of friends who he has known since junior high, and they have all been coming over nearly every evening this week to help with the move. I am extremely grateful!

I want to do something nice for them. I have wanted to buy everyone dinner a couple of the nights they were over, but either people had other plans, or the one time we ordered food, one of his friends snuck off to pay the bill before we could (that's just the kind of person he is, lol). 

Money's a bit tight right now so I'd have to wait a week or two, and it's kinda too late to do a Christmas gift for everyone anyway. But I plan on getting/doing something really nice for everyone that helped, and due to all the hard work they are doing for us for free, I wouldn't mind spending a few hundred bucks (total) on these gifts. Any suggestions?

I thought about a fancy gift basket (like with artisan bread or chocolate or wine) but is that something people actually appreciate or is it mainly just for show? Idk. I have also thought about taking everyone out to a nice restaurant that they don't get the opportunity to go to. But scheduling all 6 of them to do something at the same time seems difficult.

4869,CasualConversation,Getting a cashier’s number?,"I’m keeping my identity anonymous, but I’ll give a hint to you guys of what I am just to have an idea. I’m an Afro-Latino French Caribbean boy born in the United States. So I’ve been seeing this beautiful cashier girl who I believe is to be my age (20) since the end of the summer at Aldi’s every Friday’s.  I can tell she sorta of likes me, because there’s a lot of time I get stares from her or even times where she’s brooming behind me to get closer to me, but at the same time it’s part of her job lol. (But I feel like she does, because there’s time I have conversations in French with my mom. Idk lol). I remember the first time we saw other. I was at the front door by the banana section with my mom and she was serving someone at the register staring at me while I was staring at her walking to the sea food section.  I went to the other side of the store to get salmon as per usual, and when I was returning to the banana section by the front door, she literally turned her head just to look at me for a quick second ,and when I caught her she turned her head the other away. I was kind of shocked, because I don’t really see myself as a handsome guy. I was bullied a lot for my physical appearance as a younger kid. But as I gotten older with my observation I see sometimes girls staring at me and people telling me I’m handsome, even though I don’t believe that.  Another example, at the time when I’m leaving at the register with my mom, is that she doesn’t say anything to me as if I don’t exist, but she talks to other clients acknowledging their existence having conversations with them. We’ve had maybe 3 conservations in total of me asking general store questions and of her opening the door and locking it up (because I leave when the store is closing) saying ""Good night"" or ""Have a good evening"" staring into my eyes as if there’s something in my soul.  At the distance if you guys had seen her, you would think she’s just only a black girl, but when you get closer to her she’s actually blasian with her Asian eyes or that’s just simply me with terrible vision lol.

Now the real reason I’m posting this is because I’m type of guy that has never been in a relationship with a women, and it was not my plan at all to be in a relationship with someone anytime soon, because it’s not my priority, I like being single, and I’m not in a rush neither desperate for that, even though I LOVE black women of all kinds.  I’m the guy who prefers concentrating on myself and my goals which are way more important than a woman.  To be honest, if I was ready to get married at a certain age, it’s at the age of 35 for me, because for example people getting married at the age of 28 is a little bit too early for me, but hey you do you boo. I don’t want to be in a relationship with this girl, but I would like to know her a little bit more to at least to have an idea of her, because she’s seem like a good caring person that I don’t want to lose and that if I don’t give her my number I might feel a lot of regrets for at least not trying, but I’ve been hesitating of giving her my number.  Also, if I were to be in a relationship with her, I would like it to be long relationship for like ten years and not three years, if she would be willing to wait for a while.  My heart sometimes skips a beat when I see her.  I don’t have enough confidence in my myself to ask her for her number, because I guess you can say the fear of rejection, and also because I don’t want to disturb her while she’s working. So, I was thinking of giving a letter this Friday the 24 of December to her and giving the choice of giving her number to me. Obviously, if she’s not there this Friday, then I’ll give it to her probably the next Friday after that.  

Here’s what my letter says: ""Bonjour, my name is anonymous. I know this is your job, so I don't want to make it uncomfortable for you. I’m usually someone who doesn’t go up to a beautiful girl and talk to them face to face because I’m more of a introverted person that doesn’t talk that much or simply because I’m just someone who prefers concentrating only on myself and my goals to be in a better position physically, mentality, emotionally, spiritually, and financially.  Even though I don’t really know you that well, you seem like someone who has great character.  I thought that you were very attractive, and I wanted to know you a little bit more by growing a friendship and not being in a rush for a relationship because that’s not my number one priority for the moment. I’m not trying to pressure you into anything, but feel free to add my number at xxx-xxx-xxxx to call or text me.  IF NOT no worries.  I respect your decision 100 percent. Passez une belle nuit et Joyeux Noël!""

4881,CasualConversation,should i go quarantine with him or stay home?,"i currently live with my family. i spend most nights at my boyfriend's house though. we've been together for like... 6 months so i don't live with him yet or anything.

i slept over his house last night and was with him till about noon today. at 7 pm he suddenly became sick and this was right after we found out he was just in contact with someone who is positive for covid. with his symptoms and recent contact i would say it's a 95% chance he has covid.

i was on my way to his house tonight when he called me about being sick. now i am totally conflicted on whether i should quarantine at home or at his house.

i just took an at-home-covid-test and it said negative. i know those things are untrustworthy asf but i think it may mean i have a chance i am not contagious/symptomatic yet. 

today was my dad's birthday and i made him waffles before i knew of any this covid stuff. we don't want him to get covid bc he is old and fat and not in good health at all. last year around this exact time my whole family got covid. he got some treatment done at our doctors as soon as we found out and they said that if he hadn't done that it probably would've been a scary situation. he said since he has had covid he has had some trouble breathing. like his lungs haven't been 100% since. but that could also just be bc he has aged so much physically in the last year or two. he is vaxxed and got his booster not too long ago.

i am hoping i am not contagious yet, but i have to assume i am about to have covid, right? i hope that i didn't spread it to my family yet.

i just don't know if i should stay home tonight or go be with my boyfriend. he lives alone. if i quarantine at home i am worried i will spread it bc that's what happened last time someone in my immediate family had covid. but at the same time my brother got it about a month ago and quarantined in his room and didn't give it to anyone else.

it feels pointless to leave my house bc i fear i already gave it to them all. but my boyfriend is sick and alone and i want to be there for him. i don't have all my xmas gifts for my family wrapped and some still need to get delivered tomorrow. if i quarantined with my boyfriend i would miss christmas. if i stayed home i could at least make sure they get their presents.

my mom wants me to stay home bc she thinks there is a chance i may not have covid and that if i go see him tonight i will definitely get it. obviously that makes no sense. i have to have it, right? i was with him all morning, spent the night last night and the past few nights in a row.

this seems so stupid. i guess at the end of the day it's up to me where i want to spend my time for the next two weeks. alone, confined to my room but with all my belongings and potentially still able to spread the virus to my family if i haven't already. or go stay with him for 2 weeks and completely miss my house/family for xmas and be away from all my things.

i guess i am just confused bc my mom was so insistant on me staying home even tho i knew it made no sense. now she is saying she was wrong and i should maybe go to his house. last time i had covid i was super confused (swear the covid went to my brain) and maybe that is what is happening again rn honestly.

As the semester is finally over and I have time off I think I'm at a good time to make friends, so I am using this time to try to find and cultivate some meaningful, long-term friends while I have some time.

I love reading, especially history - I prefer nonfiction. I also like philosophy, sociology, criminal psychology, and biology. I like classical music. I love biographies and facts about famous men and women. I like reading famous words by good men and women, and I think it would be nice to have someone to share good sayings with (this is unnecessary though). I like getting myself educated, whether it's in school or by myself. I am also studying a few languages by myself for fun. Many people say they watch too much TV, but I watch too much YouTube.

Some things I don't care much for (but we can still talk even if you do; in general, I'd like if we had some interests in common - it makes the conversations more engaging):

* Sports
* Television

Ever gone online to chat forums? Omegle, tagged, hi5, etc.. meeting people online that live across the rock. I was 13/14 when I met a young man(now 25M) there that was just a year older than me. Of course I was skeptical at first, this cute boy online is my age?? And he's not just messaging me dick pics like every other guy on the line... weird. We would talk all day everyday through text messaging. He became a very good friend. We could talk about anything and everything without judgement. I desperately needed that at a young age, as did he. We were each others safe space. 

We talked for years. I was 17/18 when we stopped because I started dating someone that was physically here. The thing is, this young man I met online, we'll call him Brett... he wanted me to be his and and he wanted to meet in person.. but he lived in AZ and I lived in ND. He had been working so hard to save money for us to finally meet. When I told him what we had was just a puppy love and that it wasn't meant to be, I broke his heart. I didn't think much of it since we were long distance. I thought he would get over it. 

He messaged me October this year. It was even weirder to me because his birthday was early October and he came into my mind... he messaged me 2 weeks after that.

Since then, we text every single day. We tell each other we've never stopped thinking about each other even though we left in bad terms. It's been 5/6 years since we stopped talking.

We met for the first time end of October. I decided to fly out to him and I stayed for two nights. It feels like it was meant to be. It's like we are still those two teenage kids madly in love and dream of a future together. I met him again over Thanksgiving. This time he moved to a different state, one of my favorite cities.

I’m working hard to create my own version of Christmas for my daughter. My adult family still make it tricky, and lots of friends still question “why are you not drinking? Go on”. I’m sick of that. I have some nonalcoholic beers and nice sodas to take with me, so I feel prepared. I like to be sober and sharp for my nephews and their friends.

The point of my chat today is because I woke up to bunch of videos from some office Christmas parties, posted by friends. One where I used to work, and one where I know the culture is rotten. I think these videos have truly been the nail in the coffin.

Nobody can see how bad they look, swaying to music off beat, drink sloshing in hand, dress strap falling down, leaning in too close to their manager. They look like they are just about to vomit.

What I’m seeing is a drinking culture problem that’s been there since I can remember. And I don’t want any part of it.

I’m not trying to judge drinkers. I’m trying to journal things I could not see for myself a few years ago. If I never have another drink, it will be in large part due to office Christmas party videos.",story_by_naomi,1640216488

4941,CasualConversation,"This may seem stupid, but I suspect my best friend will let me down in about 2 weeks and I'm already hurt over it.","Some background, I have *very limited* people in my life that I fuck with on a real level. I'm friendly and caring, and I get along with most people but a solid 99% of the time I'm just faking a connection and do not actually have anything beyond a superficial friendship with nearly everyone. I have zero family, only about 3 real friends...no, 2- one of which I havent seen in 4yrs but still consider a genuine friend. I went thru a very painful breakup with my former bestfriend this last year, I'm still *greatly* struggling with that but it had to be done. 

On my birthday last year I met the dude I currently call my bestfriend. We talked in a possible dating capacity for a few weeks, and on his birthday we had our first date- a weekend getaway that turned into 12 days. We click, things are easy and comfortable, but just not right in a dating situation. We made the decision to switch it up to just a friendship and honestly I love the guy as my friend. He helped me be strong and gave me support and compassion as I navigated the breakup with my former bestfriend. His presence in my life has helped me a lot. During this past year I have helped him *a lot* financially. I have helped any and every way I can.  I have been there any time he needed someone in his corner. He crashed at my place for about 3 months even. I regularly do things to make him feel special and loved. I pay attention to things he needs and get them for him with zero expectations of being paid back. He constantly tells me he never has had anyone give him as much effort, time, attention and support as I do. It makes me so happy that my presence in his life is so positive. I also love that our friendship is an actual friendship and not some superficial FWB type of situation you'd expect from a failed hookup. 

But the dude is flaky as fuck. He's stood me up multiple times. Sent me on wild goose chases. Lied to me. Manipulated me. Etc. The nice thing is usually if there is a problem I can talk to him like an adult and he receives the information and makes an effort to adjust the behavior that caused an issue so it can be done and I won't have to hold on to resentment.

My birthday is coming up, and while I usually just skip my birthday this year I really want someone I care about to recognize it. That's my birthday wish: for someone I care about to recognize it with something that shows they know me, they get me, and they put effort into the thought. I expressed this to him in detail, formally asked him to do this for me, we discussed it and I absolutely know the message got across to him. I explained I didn't care about the cost of it, the cheaper the better in my book, but the effort is what has value to me. I'm widowed, I've spent years isolated without anyone knowing me on a deep or personal level. I dont care if it costs a single penny, I just really want to have someone I care about show that they know me well enough to get me something (or do something) that is specific to me, not a random gift suited for the masses, but something specific to ME, my needs, my wants, my interests or my quirks. 

He said he will do this for me.

My birthday is still nearly 2 weeks away, but I strongly suspect he won't follow thru and I'm getting in my feelings about it. I have spent *thousands* on him thru the year, and I did it happily because just having his friendship is beneficial to me. I recognize his financial situation is not great,",curly_who,1640212945
4942,CasualConversation,"Very nervous about starting college soon, requesting reassurance","I'm 22 and I'll be finally going to [community] college, getting my associate's degree. It'll be general studies with a few psych classes sprinkled in.

Thing is, I didn't go to high school. I got my GED after dropping out of essentially 9th grade. I was never *great* at school, I would barely scrape by with most subjects, except English/Language Arts. 

I'm so afraid that I won't be good enough or I'll get so buried in homework that I get overwhelmed and shut down. All I ever hear, from college students, that there's so much homework that free time is scarce.

I know it's not supposed to be really easy, I guess I'm just really worried that I'll fail classes or not being able to handle it.

I'm seeking for reassurance, if there's any, because it's pretty much half of my source of stress and anxiety. Sometimes I wonder if I'm making the wrong choice to drop working to be a student full time.

On top of that, I'm getting convinced that the degree won't open up hardly any job opportunities, as I don't live in an area that has a lot of people like most cities, so I feel like I'll do all this work and still won't be able to find anywhere to work that isn't retail/fast food.

It totally is the contrary and then I get somewhat of a negative feedback (at least negative to me).

I’ll have to have surgery every few years. And if I don’t get the hormones, probably even more often than that.

He was really emotionally abusive and it has taken me all this time to finally feel comfortable getting into a serious, long term potential relationship. His family, especially my ex mother in law, HATED me. We had a lot of troubles in our marriage and by the end she was writing awful, hate filled letters about me to my ex... sending them to our house!! He never stood up for me and even told me he agreed with her a lot of the time. It broke my heart and made me extremely wary of other people's families, to the point that I told my current boyfriend that hostility from his family would have to be a deal breaker for me, as I could not emotionally go through that again.

Anyway, my boyfriend's family is full of sweet, kind, loving people who have welcomed me with open arms into their circle. Even his kids seem to like me, and they're both teenagers so thats really saying something. I was pretty nervous the first time I had dinner at his parents house but from that time on they were asking him to make sure to invite me to Thanksgiving, to birthdays, and I will spend Christmas with them too.

His plan was to leave our buckets out in the sun over the closedown period and throw them in a general bin in the new year.

If they were to go in the general all it takes is one guy seeing a few too many buckets when it's emptied and he'd stop the load, have a supervisor check it then check the buckets, which the company name and address is clearly displayed, then he'd get slapped with a fucking huge fine and possibly criminal charges.

I'm generally an optimistic and confident person, but after dealing with a couple of health problems and being almost outcasted at university... I stopped recognising myself in the mirror.


I remember wondering how long this will go on for. I remember wondering ""why does no one like me? why am I useless to everyone? when will I find *my people?""*


And you know what? I didn't find my people. I didn't find a group of friends who'd help with my loneliness and give me validation and memories, nor did I blend in at uni, nor is my health significantly better,


But I am happy.


After being in an endless cycle of chasing everything, when I finally stopped and only focused on my everyday life, the weight on my mind lightened. Doing the laundry, cooking, binging my favourite anime, going on a long drive every sunday, joking with my mum and spending time with her instead of being in my room whenever I can.


It sounds so simple, yet it wasn't. It took so much of self-hatred and hatred for the world to finally understand that I'm the only person I should be trusting, that I am solely my own responsibility. The world owes me nothing nor do I owe the world anything. If I want to stop being betrayed, I have to doubt the person I want to doubt the least. If I want to stop feeling weak and intimidated, I have to tell myself I'm an equal to the person standing before me.

I’m not really sure what it means. Maybe I need to watch less television, either way I know that I cant I’m slowing down. I’m getting sleepy now.",kronimi,1640200336

4983,CasualConversation,i've never felt the absence of friends... until now.,"I reached an really important milestone; one that could have me move across the world to Paris for college. And it is now i'm realising i really have no one to share my excitement with.

 I cant talk about it with my boyfriend because he doesnt like talking abt it because i'd be moving away and we'd have to break up, and i've lost all my friends over the course of this pandemic.

I guess I just feel alone :/",throwaway_acc1705,1640199370

4985,CasualConversation,"“Piano Man” by Billy Joel is a thousand times sadder than emo music. “Piano Man” should be a trend to express sadness through music to cope, when emo or punk music doesn’t do it.","If only there were a retro “Piano Man” trend to cope with sadness by expressing it through music. I would be on board! Anyone else?

Music is my outlet. I wish “Piano Man” were a popular, retro outlet for the kind of sadness that can’t be expressed with anything emo or punk. I would be down for “Piano Man” vibes during a rougher month than usual!",Fantastic-Judgment-2,1640197399
4986,CasualConversation,I got a huge raise and don‘t know how to feel about it,"Yesterday i had my annual end of year meeting with my boss. I work as an account manager. I think my development for my company was rather good. I already earn a livable wage and enjoy the job more often than not. 
I went into our meeting in order to also talk about my wage. After having a long and pleasant talk, we get to the topic of salary. I explain that i think it should reflect my development. I was hoping for correction of inflation (5% in Germany) plus, at the most, about 10% since I handle many more and much more important customers now compared to last year. 

Well my boss gave me a 40% raise. This is really huge for me. 

However, I think I should feel really good about it and about myself. And that I deserve it. 

Somehow, thoughts are creeping in that I either dont really deserve it (I am a lot of times thinking that I might be close to impostor syndrome) or that this kind of money will somehow corrupt me, that I will become a materialist where nothing else matters and that i will now only strive for even more money. 

This is my first real job, This is the fourth full year I am working. 

This now puts me at about 90k. This is a crazy amount to me. This is in Germany.",J4nn1,1640197338

4988,CasualConversation,I almost drank my bong water.,"I'm on my laptop, drinking a smoothie, and hitting my bong. I'm mindlessly switching back and forth between each task and I grabbed my piece and caught myself before I took a swig. I sat here for a solid 5 seconds with my bong in my hand just like ""why did I almost do that?""

Anyway, that's it. Don't drink your bong water, kids.",idkidcidkidci,1640194368
4989,CasualConversation,Just a thought on life itself - a babble,"It seems like things I fear tend to come true - not exactly the way I was thinking, but still nevertheless.

Example 1: my friend and this guy I like made eye contact - my fear is they start dating - while they don't date, they still hook up together and have that chemistry that I'll never have (and she dishes it on me).

Example 2: I will celebrate my bday alone - it happens, etc.

Example 3: My friends will get married and leave me.  That might happen.

So instead of crying over it what if I flip that mentality?

Things happen.  It seems to happen the way I thought it would.  So if my fears are coming true, how about my dreams?  Will they come true?

Maybe I should have less fears and more dreams in hopes they come true.  My actions probably added to what was going to happen.  So I should start putting action into what I want to happen.  Yes, it's a long list.  Yes I only have one life.  But instead of not being able to balance it out, I'll organize, start small and just go for it.",shufflemania537,1640194013
4990,CasualConversation,I don’t like the holidays,I am a 22 year old broke college student and I honestly dislike the holidays. I have to spend money that I don’t have on a holiday I don’t even celebrate. One of my four siblings expects me to get their two kids something for Christmas. Knowing I don’t have a job. I spent half of the money (I saved up when I had a job) on my college tuition. I also have to get my mom &amp; stepdad something as well. I have a hard time saying no and it causes me to do things I don’t want to do. The holidays have always stressed me out. I just wanted  to get that off my chest.,Waste-Entertainment3,1640193784

Basically, it felt like she was saying goodbye. I do kind of understand that she wants to cut off everyone from our past school, but why does it have to include me? It feels like she doesn't really give me much importance and that kinda makes me feel shitty.",udontknowme_irl,1640193632
