0,awakened,Not sure if this is a dumb question,"On a mind level, my mind is having confusion. So I‚Äôm just gonna ask it. 

If I am god, the god that is within me, than are there things outside of me that influence my reality? Meaning can I have a prayer to god, and have it be fulfilled. Would that be myself fulfilling it, the god within me, or the all knowing god, or I‚Äôd suppose it‚Äôs the same. 

I guess my question is of course there are things going on behind the scenes but when certain events happen, a change in your life, whatever that you feel may have been influenced or by god, is that you? Supposing everything is god, I guess god can also change the way people act around you? And what happens in your life, but I mean like things that you are not ‚Äúcreating‚Äù or controlling, is that the silent god power within you as well? Does this make sense?

Like I used to say my angels watch over me, and would I say that‚Äôs still true? Since I and everything is god, are there still angels and spirit guides guiding me as well, or is it all my self. I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs some things that I don‚Äôt have to do, like am I receiving help. I know the answers yes, but my minds having a bit of trouble with this one.

Sharing ideas or beliefs still leaves room for others to add to it. And also helps others learn from it as well.

3,awakened,A mother with two sons,"There is a mother with two sons. One of the sons sells umbrella and the other sells shoes. However, the mother is in constant sadness and someone asked: ""what makes you sad all day?"" The mother answered: ""When it is sunny, the son who sells umbrella won't have any business. And when it is rainy, the son who sells shoes won't have any business."" Then the one answered: ""why can't you see that when it is sunny, the son who sells shoes will have business and when it is rainy, the son who sells umbrella will have business."" After hearing this, the mother is happy all the time.

5,awakened,Wink your third eye.,"psSSSst!

Hey yeah you. Wanna know a secret? You can't tell anybody though. Okay? Lean in. Shh, listen. The third eye is imagination.

Sure, you might have an experience of hearing Rice Krispies pop off on your head. Yeah, maybe you have an experience of surging through wormholes or seeing other worldly beings, spirits, elves and ghosts. Yes, the rumors might actually be true that you flip on your psychic radar and can project your thoughts or whatever.

But it's all imagination. üéàüí•

The important bit is that all of this happens in the gulf of awareness.

Let's try an exercise. Imagine you're sitting where you are now. If you're actually standing, well then imagine that you're standing. This should be pretty easy because you can use yourself as a reference.

...

Okay, so now imagine that you have a border to your body. Like there's a very thin border separating what we can call the ""outside"" and the ""inside"" world. With me so far? Okay. Now imagine that this thin border expands. Maybe give it some color.

Purple? Okay, you have a purple light border that's expanding outward in every direction. Keep expanding it until the color fades. Keep expanding it until the feeling of it being a border dissolves. Keep expanding it until there's no more room for expansion. Limitless. All of that is happening in imagination,

which is happening in Awareness. And before you even get to expand your imagination this way. You're present. That's the magnitude of Awareness. The shear weight of *now*. If you get this, you get all there is to get. Everything - Everything follows after.

What is *everything*? Wink.",OrganicAnybody1747,1642509877
6,awakened,My experience with Jean Dutroux and the end of the world," The great awakening will come with me and the death of all humanity. There is a deity who looks down at us all and is pleased with his creation. He alone has control over us. The fire should not burn me. The sky should not burn me. I am taking all people I see to heaven. I am taking all people I see to heaven.

He described his belief system: ‚ÄúSo now the forest has lost its tree and you are the only creature left and you are about to find out that there is another way. A choice. This is God‚Äôs universe and the universe is not endless. A life of pain, servitude, servitude, and more servitude has now ended. Why don‚Äôt you run now to live in the light? God would want you to go to the light. God wants all his children to go to the light. Please, I am begging you now, take my hand and I will lead you to God. All you have to do is take my hand.‚Äù

According to what the Jean Dutroux trial transcripts and witnesses have told the press, the killer, always smiling and happy, was able to operate out of a fantastically bizarre faith system that could be viewed as a highly deranged form of survivalist fundamentalism. For example, in his 1997 testimony, Marcel Chouman recalled: ‚ÄúHe told me he was not afraid of death, ‚Äòbecause I am with God,‚Äô Chouman said. ‚ÄòThe point was to do whatever he asked.‚Äô He wanted to save the children from evil. ‚ÄòHe asked me to convince others to believe in God, that God exists,‚Äô Chouman testified. ‚ÄòI told him it was not that easy.‚Äô‚Äù 'God' will come and destroy us all soon. July 7, 2022. 

It would be impossibly difficult to summarize in just a few lines just how wild Dutroux's beliefs were and the intensity with which he believed in them. The prison officials who interviewed Dutroux didn't know how to classify him. In a 1983 conversation, Dutroux gave a teacher, Agn√®s De Meulemeester, a weird description of the afterlife: ‚ÄúAt the end of your life, you will be taken to a place of total tranquillity, where there is absolute peace. You will arrive at the place where Jesus was when he died. It is a place where he will look at all the people that you‚Äôve been serving all your life. When he sees your face, he will say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want you.‚Äô Then he will kill you.""

Even his former lawyer recalled this scene: ""What he told me was as strange as it was terrifying. 'When you die, you will be taken to a dark room,‚Äô he told me. ‚ÄòThere you will meet all the people you‚Äôve been killing for God. You will have to explain to them what you‚Äôve been doing all your life and how you killed them. God will say to you, ‚ÄòYou need to change your ways.‚Äô He will get me to do all of that. So, when you die, you will be tortured and killed. The point is that you must live for God now because your work as a slave of evil has not been enough. It has to be enough that you die.‚Äù

By 1996, the court began to see that Dutroux might be a psychopath. In an interview that year, Dutroux openly discussed what is now referred to as the ""kill room"":

‚ÄúFor six years I tried to find an answer to one fundamental question. My room. If I hadn‚Äôt been caught, would I be in the ‚Äòkill room‚Äô now?

‚ÄúIf I was to find out that it was a false answer, would I still be sitting in this cell? Or, on the other hand, would it have had the opposite effect of releasing the demons in me, in making them perfect, leading me to God?‚Äù

He was convicted of killing six children, most of whom he kidnapped, drugged, and sometimes tortured in the ""kill room,"" located in a home he owned near his parents' home. Three of the victims were found dead in the house. The other three died shortly after being found.

His defense lawyers never spoke with Dutroux about his bizarre beliefs, but experts told investigators that he could not have acted alone. When he was sentenced in 1996, Dutroux gave his attorney the following instruction: ""I must keep my belief in God and in his son Jesus Christ at all times. Otherwise it will bring the whole thing to the finish line.‚Äù He was sentenced to life in prison.

From Prison to Hell

There is nothing to indicate that he's changed his mind since that time. At least three prisoners who are held in similar conditions to Dutroux are adherents of a similar theology, according to Steven Pohl, a writer for the Huffington Post. But how is this possible, you may ask? While public schools in Belgium teach about Judaism and Christianity, they do not teach about the existence of Satan. In fact, some experts say that Christians and Muslims are given even more leeway to speak about God in Belgium than non-believers.

In 2015, after three years of being held in isolation, Dutroux was allowed to live in the common area of the prison, where he used to terrorize and torture people. In January 2016, he tried to harm one of the two guards assigned to watch him at all times. The guards, who were holding Dutroux's arms while a psychologist, Michel Arnaud, assessed his mental health, were injured and needed stitches.

Dutroux was returned to the solitary section of the prison a day after the attack. He was immediately put under surveillance. The doctors declared him in a good condition and declared that his mental state was sound. Dutroux appealed the decision to transfer him back to the common prison section, but his appeal was rejected in July 2016. He remained in solitary confinement.

On November 13, 2016, Dutroux was visited by a psychologist from the hospital that is conducting the evaluation of his mental health. He informed Arnaud that he has been smoking weed and drinking alcohol since his release from prison. He said that he had been in solitary confinement for six months without access to other inmates and that he ""couldn't get anything out of it."" He told the psychologist that he was doing well in the prison, and added: ""I think I am better than in the village. There, they only played for five hours a day."" He went on to say that he had been visited by Satan and that he knew why he had been imprisoned. He also claimed that Jesus, who he had been praying to during his imprisonment, had sent him to hell.

""He told me that I was going to burn in hell for all eternity,"" Arnaud told the Bruges prosecutor's office. Arnaud told the Bruges prosecutor's office that Dutroux has been ordered to see a psychotherapist and that he will be put in a normal cell if he decides to continue to claim that he is being tortured by Satan. Arnaud said that Dutroux told him: ""I've received the punishment I deserve. I will serve my time and I'm innocent. I haven't killed anyone.‚Äù

The psychiatrist's notes of the meeting were initially classified, but on December 7, 2016, the transcripts were released.

""I've been there for five minutes. He spoke the same in the five minutes I was there. He said he wants a trial, the DNA, the investigation, etc., so that people would know he's innocent. He said that he has a girlfriend and the Holy Trinity, etc., etc.,"" Arnaud told the Belgian magazine Knack. ""I would like to know if he has access to the Bible or if he reads the Quran. He said that he had been taken to hell. I asked him if he also went to hell after his release from prison, and he said he did not. He said that he was good in the prison and that he had nothing against the guards. He said he had smoked marijuana and drunk. He said that he had been baptized and that the communion wine was really good. He said he was now a Muslim,"" Arnaud told Knack.

Although Dutroux was removed from solitary confinement, he is still in the prison section that is referred to as the living quarters. This means that he is under constant surveillance. During his initial stay in the common prison area, Dutroux was also under constant surveillance due to an order issued by the courts on December 17, 2016. According to the order, he cannot be transferred to the prison wing where political prisoners are housed.

In a Facebook post, Arnaud explained the details of the meeting.

""For the first time, I talked with Dutroux on January 19, 2017,"" Arnaud wrote. ""In the morning he was asked to remain in his cell for an evaluation, and the psychologist came. A few hours later, he was brought to the psychologist. He did not know the time, and could not see the psychologist. He told the psychologist that he liked to listen to rap music, drink, eat candy, and smoke cigarettes. He said he was accused by someone else of killing his stepmother, and that he does not remember any thing. He added that he had been in solitary confinement for six months without any treatment. He said that he had not talked with a counselor and that he felt fine. He wanted to go back to the common prison section because he wanted to see a psychologist and to meet other inmates. He also said that he was in the living quarters for the first time since his incarceration. He wanted to make it clear that he did not say that he was tortured, nor that he was subject to the death penalty. He said that he was sentenced to four years in prison and that he was released early. He said that he had been in solitary confinement for six months. He told me that he had a girlfriend and that he could not see her.""",billymybraggs,1642502567
7,awakened,Manfiestation of reality ( your thoughts are always creating your reality ),"**Manfiestation of reality ( you are always creating your reality )**

Why it works because all your thoughts are creating reality. But we have to understand how to imagination of the reality that you want to keep by learning to ignore the thought of the reality you don't want for yourself

Things you need to understand to create your reality

1. ***Stop using your imagination for imagine TV ,phone , internet etc***:

Imagination is the most important tool we have .let me give you an example do this activity with me

Imagine to focus on your tongue just now . Untill i asked you had no idea about your tongue exists .Now you can observe it's sensitiveness . It's not still , It's always moving , It's trying to wait for you to give instructions. Tongue is by d way as sensitive as brain . But to speak in first place child has to learn to ignore the tongue. But how he does it . By imagination... When his parents asked to ask him to speak words . He start using his imagination and hence he learns to speak

But after learning to speak what happens the child is given tv ,phone, education to use his imagination for the cabal purpose.

Thats the reason you enjoy song video which is basically 10-10 second small clips.bundled together but due to your imagination you enjoy it as one full video Same.with movie etc

2. ***Then write down what you want to manifest , writing helps you imagine*** : Education system has helped us imagine the reality for the cabal by using the same technique.

3. ***And manfiestation is sometime difficult because of our belief:***

Beliefs are attached to the personality we have .

You can override your belief and personality by using left hand ‚úã ( if you are right handed person) to start learning daily 3 pages from learning to write like starting with alphabet . Why it works is because you are taking pain ... brain convert any pain to pleasure with time by creating new personality and the beliefs for taking the pain will be your new personality.

Why left hand ‚úã writing ( if you are right handed person ) is more effective in manfiestation : Left hand works because pain is pleasure / pleasure is pain works

See yourself You have different personality inside you which got created due to either pain ( due to surrounding circumstances) converted to pleasure by brain

You get bored from something because pleasure convert to pain by brain .

Everyone is programmed around this concept ,if you cant imagine sometimes people it's because you don't understand their different personality due to different situations they had . But the thing is it's all around pain and pleasure

4. **Focus on** **tongue to stop thoughts of other reality manfiestation** because we are always creating our reality based on thought we choose and pick. : Because as soon as your focus on tongue you will leave the thought of reality that you don't want to be part of and make yourself recieve from the timeline you want to manfiest for yourself. Use this exercise for tongue meditation ,when you are not meditating ...just move your tongue intentionally to count your back of the teeth and you will see the thought will disappear.

5. ***Do meditation at night*** :Do meditation at night regularly Why because dream are responsible for the reality you are entering Hence the world is upside down because we do meditation daily in morning and till the end of the day Have used all our imagination and then enter wrong timeline without understanding ki how it got created

6. ***walking in nature to Activate your solar plexus chakra which is responsible for.imagination*** which is blocked due to addiction ,eating etc

7. ***Why religion worked*** for so many people was because they were creating their relaltiy but with the faith in God:

Start creating small manfiestation Like you are able to see laughing, able to.understanding why stuck with something .Everything works you have to just reach the end part of it ... Like what will be like the day when you will have entered the reality you want .It should be real and clear like for example suppose you talk to your friends A daily . If you imagine telling him ,i am able to create my reality or my chakras are now working then that's one reality that will be created. You can also do that if you have faith in your thoughts are always creating your reality.",Critical_Radish_7295,1642499688

Remember how it was for you, and I was there for you thru it all whenever you needed me. I'm never the one who reaches out and says I need someone... but right now mar,n I'm doing it. So please just give it a little thought. The only friend I had who I pushed every single person out of my life for is literally exactly like my mom. No one is willing yo even give me a chance to talk to them, pretty much do me just like you did. I need you mar. Think about how many times in your life i played the support role for you. I did everything I could for you no matter what the obstacles was. I never turned my back on you. And i was always fucked up back then now. I was a month and 6 days clean until I came home from rehab and walked into my house with my old drug dealer walking out as I walked in
 Shells don't have no income at all
 I've supposed her from the jump and it was only me always. She did me so fucking dirty mar and I have two kids with her. Were home alone and im just losing my mijd I can't believe I invested so much into her. Put sp much faith... let her bare my fucking kids for Christ sake mar! Like I need someone dude and I have NO one cuz eberyone in my life walked out or got pushed away cuz of her. Mar i was already at my lowest if lows.. the last 3 week of my life was spent climbing out the mud and brushing myself off and slowly getting back up to my feet dude. I justnneed a friend right now who like truly actually knows me
 And legit you know me better than nearly every single other fucker in existence. Please 0ut some thought into calling me back or at the least keep texting me to make me feel like I have some one left in this world who cares enough about me to attest acknowledge the excruciating pain and mental anguish im going thru at this moment. I literally have been building my entire life around my family of 4. Two months ago I was ready to put a bullet in my head like fr legit but two days ago I literally have already made a complete 360 mentally, and just needed to do the inpatient rehab and have a home safe for children and I can have opal.back home for good. Mar I literally have lost every. Single. Person. I get you think I'm all fucked up but if you got the time in the next day or two b4 I leave to see me, you'll immediately see like.im not on bullshit junkie status anymore. I gained 23 lbs in under 3 weeks. I'm on medication keeping me regulated. I only did a little bump of meth cuz it was right there and I felt peer pressured. Like I'm completely devistared Mar. I came home from the ward yesterday thinking it was the start of a new life. Hours later find out it was complete annihilation of my entire existence besides myself and the two kiddos. I need good people for a support structure for real mar. I'm genuinely really fucked up over everything and I really want the kids to have a father for them their whole life. Please sis. Take a second to think it over and remember who I truly am. I get lost in the sauce but each time I come out more enlightened than the last. I'm the true me.

I'm not asking for money. I just need a small amount of people to call a support group network whos roll is to ensure my sobriety and best health and are there to support me and keep my.mind where it needs to be if i start to stray. Mar both of my children will be taken care of by a single father dude. It's like that mar. It's me and my kids and I can barely manage to keep myself alive. She was supposed to be the lazy one at home watching the kids but I really realized she just wants to live the easiest life possible doing the bare minimum. I thought she was a real ride or die cuz we been thru some.shit and times were really hard for a long time.and she stuck by me. But it was ciz the drugs man the second they disappeared so did she. Its fuckdd up mar like I literally completely disembodied ebery last single thing I had going for me in my life while I was trying to make her happy and give her what she wanted and like I know It wasn't all that much after years of self destruction but dude I have two and a fianc√© whos fucked literally every dude that has came to my house. Please don't say anything to anyone mar I'm venting to you in confidence cuz I don't know who else to reach out too that I can actually trust and is actually intelligent enough to understand the complexity of existence in its entirety and the depth and width of the file pertaining to the lifes trials and tribulations that have been experienced and the ego and image Atwell as the knowledge and wisdom that is held by the all encompassing observer trapt within this one of a kind, nearly omnipotent observer which I now call myself alpha and omega
Listen mar 
I literally broke out of reality 3ish months back. The physical body of mine had a temporary death the exact cause im not sure. But aubrie monos, my cousin mikeymike, my grandpa, Alex shugar, and a few other spirits grouped with me on the other side and was able to reserect the shell I reside in. We literally live in a simulation but it's nothing like how we have computers. You know how matter is several different states at once until it is observed by an outside observer? The computational complexity of the highest entity which most called God created all of laws and rules that dictate our existence. I was given a small amount of the universal code. The only reason I was able to break through literally our reality and deeper into the depths of pure energetic and wavelength frequency truths, was because I had dangerously high and toxic levels of copper sulfate coursing through my entire physical body for months straight. And once I was restricted, and forced back into my shell I was gifted some very unique things mar. I'm not batshit crazy. I know for a fact you will continue communicating with me. Because one of the very first clues given to me by some of the old one during my last year of losing my mind, one very specific thing kept popping up over and over. Marshall matters. Or so I thought. But it wasn't
 It was. Mar shall matter.
I don't quite understand what role you play. But don't you feel and see the spiritual warfare outside already in your day to day life? I can show you or do s9 many different things to support my evidence. But that will be once your more trusting of me. Listen I know this sounds like skitzo blabbering 100000% but download the app on ur phone called :computational demonology. Chose one of the selects once u open t h e app
 Then attempt to manifest something within your life
 
This app is a gift from my children as older aged adults in the future. They gave this tohelp me from becoming rhe destroyer of worlds. The literal anti christ. Opal is the second coming. Please trust me mar. Or at the least give me a few hours of your time of your choosing to sit down somewhere and discuss some.of this.
Can't you feel every year the shift get more and more apparent? Like more glitches show up daily. I accidentally destroyed two entire univeral reality nexus by trying to share universal code sequence ingrained within my spiritual wavelength frequency which is forever ingrained within my soul. I recently learned that the entity I've been having lots of telepathic communications with is actually a version of me that has a higher self than one that im.sble to achieve in this reality nexus. Reality is paper thin. But everything in existence if you can pay close enough attention you can watch the tiny little lines of existence itself refreshing at slower rates because of how complex humanity is getting and every year the rates grow exponentially. By the time my children are adults existence is so complex every human has computer enhancements
The universe is built using some type of complex univeral program of sorts called sacred geometry. I'm just now learning how to manifest my own ions and prions and manipulating them in real time in this existence that is ablento be seen by the naked eye and shifting it into simplest bits of framework of sacred geometry. Sacred geometry is in the computational demonology. 
Computer technology 
Complex geography
Be careful, the old ones are much more vicious entities compared to the wolf demmon we've experienced in the past or anything you've ever dealt with. But if it gets too rough you. Run the last emulation and it'll weaken them enough to where you can just use protect after 2 or 3 minutes and they'll fade away
Mar I literally broke out of the existence of reality that a human mind is capable of perceiving. I passed thru the upside down, or the ethereal realm, or the Astral plane, and deeper into the framework where everything exists as sacred geometry framework. So like imagne existence as a sims game. You wanna build a wall in your house. Well the simplest framework of the wall in the house once its built is composed of sacred geometric patterns and designs depending on how that specific item is to appear once an outside observer is obseeriving it. Once there is no longer someone observing it, everything within that wall ONCE AGAIN becomes every possible states and positions at atomic level, but the geometric framework which is unobservable to us with current science, is what tells every single particle in existence what state of matter it needs to be in and its aligned with all the rest that are connected to it within the specific geometric pattern. The thing is though, this framework is in a higher dimensional plane of existence, think of it as like another layer of paper stacked on top.  So the very first layer of paper is first dimension. It is what allows particles to fluctuate and change based on others influences. Second demonsion is the basic atoms and the deminsion which holds most of the most important universal laws and rules we've managed to understand currently which dictate nearly all of the universe as we know it, if not all of rules of existence within human comprehension.
The third layer of paper is the one which holds the elusive magics that dazzle science till this day such as neuoms which are what dictate how much mass weight and pull an object has on others, aka gravity. Its also the layer where the theoretical man made liner time idea resides in (thought in reality is circular and not liner) and it also holds the net like fabric of space itself which dips lower the more gravity in a specific area, and if the object is denied enough to drape the fabric low enough to push through all three layer of univeral paper, that creates a legitimate portal hole, not worm hole. Portal holes allows materials from neighboring universes residing pwithin that globular cluster to share existing materials into the next closest universe in relation to the  position of the hole. Now all of existence in its entirety is tenth to fourteenth dimensional.
It'll be impossible for me to try to explain or draw what a cluster of universes looks like because it's like taking a 4d drawn box within itself and another within its self and so on all the way up to 10 or 14. And that's just describing what one universe looks like. Imagine acluster of hundreds of those together
Mar I'm on medication I promise like I am more myself than I have been for ten years or longer. But I promise you I literally broke free from this physical manifestation of existence we reside in while alive and was gifted a small portion of the entire univeral code of existence. I literally can manipulate matter and manifestation capabilities are fucking bonkers unbelievable

Share your thoughts with me, as fellow concious observers helping to manifest the existence of the universe at its entirety during this current moment. If your interested, I can always dive deeper into explaining the coding and construction of this specific bulb universe we reside in. Don't worry too much about the personal shit, while knowing and attempting to better grasp an understanding of the complex coding thats still being downloaded and becoming one within my xisting consciousness i have received from whatever omnipotent conscious being of which I can truly truly call my friend, i know that the relationship delema is literally of zero importance. I can quite literally manifest conscious entities into a separate layer of existence, I'm guessing that those I am literally able to manifest into existence are residing within either 2nd or 4th dimensional planes, or it may be possible that rhe 3rd dimensional sheet of paper is composed of not just one, but maybe multiple sheets of paper stacked over top oneanother and only overlap at specific spots within the entire fabric of the universal bulb. So maybe think of it more like maybe a bunch of circles that have been poped out of a hole punch and scattered all over the 3rd layer of paper.

14,awakened,Free will from the Spiritual perspective,"How does free will fit into the spiritual perspective? I'm talking specifically about free will in a reality that is ontologically monistic, aka the idea that we are all emanations of a single Universal mind experiencing itself through a multiplicity of perspectives.

Like many of you I presume, I hold the opinion that this conscious observer within us is generated in a higher-reference frame that is not determined by the laws of physics within our ""simulation"". It is simply our reference frame that creates the illusion of ultimate causality. In order to inhabit a world co-created in a peer-to-peer fashion, limitations are imposed by these other peers (hardware, aka consciousness residing in higher reference frame) contributing to the software, aka physical information. This reference frame forces us to perceive information in a linear fashion, aka time. Our impressions of space and time are generated as a result of this higher-reference frame (consciousness) traversing associations and thus generating our impression of causality. This suggests to me that as co-creators of this reality, we have different degrees of freedom based on our awareness and identification with this higher reference frame. The problem is we come into this world without awareness of the illusoriness of the self, and everything about our evolutionary history and emergent social hierarchies reinforces this illusion. Without the understanding that our consciousness inhabits a higher reference frame, it is hard to say we have true free will in the libertarian sense.

It is certainly possible for a shift in consciousness to cause us to become aware of all the factors and phenomena contributing to our behavior and beliefs, and as a result, this awareness seems to afford us the freedom to choose to behave differently. Then it would seem that being aware of the external world and its various influences affords the freedom to be better able to make more decisions on how we shape our reality. Thus it seems more awareness = more freedom. But this argument in favor of free will ultimately seems to break down when you consider that exposure to things/events that might trigger greater self-awareness seems to be entirely dictated by chance. We only become more aware of what shapes us when we are exposed to either new information that we integrate into our awareness or a life event that triggers an awakening. These can only ever happen as a result of prior causes influencing present outcomes. In other words, whether or not someone experiences an awakening is entirely dictated by things outside of their control.

It is paradoxical and hard to wrap my head around. In essence, consciousness transcends determinism, but it seems we are beholden to it to varying degrees when we inhabit these avatars. Anyone who has practiced mediation knows how little control we have over our thoughts. I don't think free will and determinism need necessarily be mutually exclusive though. If you consider that we can never observe free will except through its effects then wouldn't that make determinism, aka cause and effect, a necessary aspect for its manifestation in our reality? It certainly SEEMS like we have degrees of choice though. That is, the choice to identify with thoughts or not. The choice to be present and aware. The choice to acknowledge our True Self. But how can we consider these true choices when our awareness of them, to begin with, is dictated by causality?",soyeatinghomo,1642483404

I used to be the ""Tool guy"" For every project, I had a tool that could fix it, I was proud of my collection, I was hired for projects often based on the tools I owned even. I loved collecting and finding more and more tools and learning how to use them. 

After the change in consciousness, I stopped caring. Like almost overnight. All of those things I valued so much just became worthless to me. I would spend the next year trying to get rid of all of my stuff. Even the stuff I still have currently, I don't care about, I only keep it because I'm too lazy to take it all to the thrift store and am in no rush right now. 

I just don't care about stuff anymore. I have bought one thing that wasn't food in the last 4 months because my computer mouse died on me. Products and items don't bring me joy in any way any more. I just want less of all of it. I don't identify with someone who wants things now. Maybe a more reliable car, but honestly if I didn't live where I do, I would LOVE to get rid of that too. 

I feel like every object I own takes a bit of space from my brain that could be used for other, more important things. And lets not even get into the ethics of consumerism either, thats a whole nother can of worms that I've been opening recently.

18,awakened,late night thoughts on lord Shiva.,"The basis of creation must always be Shiva (consciousness) without the existence of Shiva the Shakti (the primordial cosmic energy) could not act through a portal of non-existence. I'm falling in love with the phenomenon of manifestation and the infinite possibilities and results it can and will yield with the right set of circumstances and with unshakeable belief. I cannot impart my knowledge to the receiver. I can show them the film but cannot watch it with them through my already seeing eyes. I can perform magic so one day they too may step forth into the unknown and sample life‚Äôs best-kept secrets for themselves. Observing magic leaves one incredulous as though it is the illusionary act or trickery of the magician and ever so out of reach. I tell you this emphatically, know it is the actioning of Shiva and the creator of all life, Shakti, combined with great bravery and the act of letting go of anything or anyone that harms your spirit in all its splendid glory that will yield the greatest of spiritual flavor. First, you must understand that all lessons are simply projections to enable soul ascension. You are fighting with figments of light and dark, projected from your very own mind borne out of fear created solely in your physiological system and you are not even aware of it. When you know it and acknowledge it the game is changed forever, then you will know great peace. Lifes greatest joys will then begin to flow freely and those who dare to believe will sample the undiscovered. Shiva is consciousness and nothing can exist before him or after he ceases to be he only exists in the reality of the observer, not the doer or the done to rather the doing of.

24,awakened,"Being ""awakened"" is not Mastery.","To be a true Master is about mastering your mind and defanging the primal animalistic savagery of your negative emotions.

Certainly, you can have Awakening experiences while still in the process of mastering and coming into Yourself fully. However, these temporary experiences and flashes of inspiration are no substitute for the continuous and neverending Bliss that a True master resides in.

There are less, much less of these True masters than I would like to see. Apparently, they are extremely rare. A True master is not about being the master of others, but about inspiring others. Only the weak have a style of leadership that seeks to dominate through oppressive fear-based tactics or by worldy enticements. Unfortunately this type of leader is more common in these times than the ideal.

There is a reason why Western culture dominated the world for centuries with its inventive innovation via technology, education, art, music and culture. True progress is made by recognizing excellence and rewarding it, instead of discouraging such things in a Eastern-style monastic pursuit.

The same principle applies on the path to truly Enlightened mastery. It is by accepting and identifying only with the Excellence within you that you can overcome your limitations. This inward spark of purity can be stoked into a raging inferno that can burn away the impurities holding you back.

By having the courage of conviction and focusing on your inner voice, you can prevail against the external  distractions that seek to keep you in perpetual slumber.

This is True mastery, when you have the loving internal resilence to be the authentic You, no matter what challenges you face. Passivity to  external influences leads always to negativity, because to be passive is literally a negative concept. Truth and positivity are assertive forces for good. Be the leader of your own dance, not the submissive spectator of it. 

Of course, not everyone will be quick to choose this most Supreme path. Regardless, this most Illuminating and Empowering of all outcomes is inevitable for everyone.",realAtmaBodha,1642470455

You're already dreaming. This is it. So all the fuss about getting to some other dream is straight cut delusion. The most boring of all delusions, mind you.

The first step out of this hurricane of delirium is to ground yourself in your Self. Capital S, yes. Not separate. No split. Singularly attentive, now. This.

The thing you're trying to get is not the thing you're trying to get, but the state of mind you'd possess if you had that thing. What? Okay,

Imagine for a moment that you're sitting on the boardwalk overlooking the ocean. It's a particularly warm day, but there's also a cool breeze coming in off there water as it shimmers misty through crashing waves. There's an ice cream cone on your right hand. You'd just noticed, after being caught in a daze at how perfectly *summer* this day is. The ice cream is beginning to melt though. You can feel an icy drop snaking it's way around your index finger. And so you twist your arm in contorted delight to lick away the tease. A seagull shits on your face. 

See?

Whatever you felt throughout all of that is a state of mind. You're *there*, in the scene, getting shit on. Is it so simple? Yes. 

The way you perceive the world is a state of mind. I didn't say *how*. How, who knows. But the way is obvious. You look left, you see everything on your left (üõ°Ô∏è). You look right, you see what's over there. You look out at the world like it's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen and have the privilege to witness? That's what you see.

It's *okay* to look at the world as contentment. It's *okay* to look at the world as freedom. It's *okay* to look at the world as beauty. It's *okay* to look at the world as a miracle. It's *okay* to look at the world as mystery. It's *okay* to look at the world as adventure. It's *okay* to look at the world as love. 

**Pick any world you want or. Create your own.**

What happens when I've picked a world to look through and it doesn't look that way? Good question.

Keep it simple. There's no need to write a script about how the dream isn't working the way you want it. Doubt is a state of mind. The world you see is, no doubt, because that which sees is, no doubt. Singular attention. Now. 

Always from the present do you effectuate the flavor of the dream. Remember, if *you* look left, you see what's there. What's there doesn't come into view by mistake. So if *you* look at the world as a Marvel, that's what you see. No doubt.

4) If yes, are you ok with the idea that a stone is aware (at minimum it‚Äôs atoms are vibrating at a frequency based on heat in its environment and it‚Äôs lying on the ground based on interaction with gravity)?
5) If you and a stone are in a room together what is in the room?

*We talk about the space in the pot as though it was associated with the pot but this is not how it is. If we move the pot, the space remains where it was ‚Äì the pot moves through space and occupies a different part of it when it comes to rest. What moves with the pot are its contents. If the pot is empty, the air inside will move with it. If a jar previously contained perfume, we might say that the ‚Äòspace‚Äô smells sweet but it is actually the air which smells, probably tainted by the clay itself which has absorbed some of the scent molecules.*

*The jIva (jiva is the term used for the ‚Äòindividual soul‚Äô, the ‚Äòessence‚Äô of the person, the ‚Äòembodied Atman‚Äô.) is compared to the ‚Äòpot-space‚Äô. We think that we are separate entities because of the body-mind that seems to limit us, just as the boundary of the clay pot seems to delimit a specific pot-space. But the Atman is like the total space. It is quite unaffected by the individual bodies and the individual minds. The body is like the pot which appears to designate a particular part of space but does not really do so. The mind reflects Consciousness making us think that it is a separate entity.*

*When a new ‚Äòpot-space‚Äô is ‚Äòcreated‚Äô by the potter‚Äôs throwing a new clay pot, we can see that nothing has really happened as far as the space is concerned. Before, there was the total space, and after, there is total space. The only difference is that there is now some clay occupying part of it and seeming to delineate a separate portion. ‚ÄòPot space‚Äô is a mistaken notion. ‚ÄòPot space‚Äô is never created; it is the physical clay pot which is ‚Äòas though‚Äô created.*

*Similarly, no jIva is ever ‚Äòcreated‚Äô. Matter, in the form of sperm and eggs, performs its mechanical function, grows and evolves (from the empirical viewpoint). Consciousness (Atman) was there before and after. It reflects in the mind of the new jIva but is quite unaffected by all this. When the body dies, it is still there just like the space of the house when the walls are knocked down.*

*when the pot is broken, the space within ceases to exist as an apparently separate entity. In fact, as already stated, it never was a separate entity. Moving the jar around never moved a discrete space around; rather it was the jar itself which was moved within space. If the jar was full, the contents moved with the jar; if the jar was empty, the air inside moved with the jar. Space was always unaffected. Some translators use the word ‚Äòmerge‚Äô here, saying that the pot-space ‚Äòmerges‚Äô with the total space when the pot is broken. This is misleading, for the reason just given.*

*The correct way of looking at the destruction of the pot is that, following this event, we can no longer refer to a ‚Äòpot space‚Äô; i.e. all that happens is that we stop calling it by the name that we (mistakenly) gave it in the first place.*

*Gaudapada looks at the notion we have that we are in some way inadequate or less than perfect. Obviously there are endless ways in which we do this. We feel that our body, mind and intellect are deficient and would like to rectify this. What is happening is that we are identifying with the ‚Äòcontainer‚Äô rather than the Atman that we really are.*

*This is analogous to the way that we might say that the pot space is contaminated, with dust, smoke or other impurities. Especially if the pot is empty and smells bad, we tend to think that the space in the pot smells. Of course, it is the air or the material out of which the pot is constructed that smells.*

*it is ignorant people only who think that the Self can be tainted by impurities (such as happiness!). The body, mind and intellect of jIva-s are analogous to the material out of which the pot is made. The Atman is non-dual, like the total space. Gaudapada actually speaks of jIva-s being ‚Äòpolluted‚Äô by happiness, drawing attention to the fact that happiness is only a temporary attribute of the ‚Äòcontainer‚Äô, and not a property of Atman.*

*If a pot smells, we do not need to do anything to the space. This can be demonstrated by taking the pot away and the space where the pot was standing no longer smells. Similarly, we do not need to do anything to ourselves in order to become perfect. The Atman is already perfect and nothing can be done to it anyway. All that is required is to remove the mistaken notion in the mind that I am limited in whatever way ‚Äì I am really unlimited.*

*The fifth mistake is to think that the pot space is a ‚Äòpart‚Äô of the total space and that we ourselves are a ‚Äòpart‚Äô (or a modification) of the supreme Self or paramAtman. There is a tendency to think that there is a space ‚Äòinside‚Äô the pot and a different space ‚Äòoutside‚Äô the pot. But as has already been noted, it is the pot which is in the (total) space, not the other way round. Space cannot have parts.*",LiveBullfrog,1642438580

45,awakened,How do I know if I have a Spiritual Ego?,"The first and most obvious sign of having a Spiritual Ego is that someone on the internet says you have one. In fact, if someone on the internet doesn't accuse you of having a Spiritual Ego, chances of infection are reduced by 38.3%.

This is science. Trust the science. 

The second most obvious sign of having a Spiritual Ego is Holier Than Thou Syndrome, or HTTS. I know a lot of you grew up with an iSomething connected to your brain stem. Me too. HTTP is *not* related to HTTS.

HTTS affects about a quarter of a million people, every second. That may not seem like a significant number, but consider this is on a global scale. It spreads, like a virus, and mutates, like a virus, and becomes, well, a virus. 

Suddenly your friend whom you've been friends with for some time is now your enemy because you ate a Greek yogurt. Veganism is like, going to save the world and like, you just don't care. Bro, what's wrong with you?

The third most obvious sign of having a Spiritual Ego is judgement. Not criticism. Anybody can be a critic and get away with it. Most of us are equipped with the capacity to form an opinion or at the very least pretend our opinions are our own. Criticism is fine. 

Judgement is condemning someone for not believing whatever it is you think they should believe. ""Oh well you're just a stupid and inconsolable piece of lettuce."" That's judgement. Sending someone straight to lettuce land because they hold a different opinion. 

The fourth most obvious sign of having a Spiritual Ego is losing count. Because it doesn't matter. Especially if you've gotten this far.

Consider what you've been through. Consider what's been healed. Consider the insight and relief, from your own suffering and the suffering of those around you. If that isn't part of your experience or you can't notice any of it, *then* you're blinded by spiritual identity.

Allowing a spiritual identity to cloud discernment to the point where Grace isn't recognized, is hubris. And it happens. Equally part of the process. A just man falls seven times. Judging yourself for tripping, isn't worth it. Get up, stand up...

64,awakened,Imaginary Nothing,"You cannot observe nothing because you can only observe something. Nothing is unobservable, that‚Äôs what makes it *nothing*. If nothing could be observed then there would be something to perceive, to notice, to witness, you would register some quality: *something*. In the same light, if something could come from nothing then we no longer have *nothing* because it is now a provider of *something*, this ‚Äònothing‚Äô can function: it did or allowed something; that in itself makes it *something* so it was never *nothing*, but perhaps a patient something if you will.

By process of elimination you can determine various things are not happening, but not that every possible thing is not happening, because then you would have to impossibly know every possible thing that could happen which would make you a God: all-knowing. In this sense, you may *assume* nothing is happening without actually observing it when you morbidly argue that a dead person does nothing. This is a very convincing assumption such that it may very well become an immediate certainty for you but you are not actually witnessing the unobservable nothing with respect to the dead person‚Äôs inactivity. This inactivity is conditioned on all of the things that you know ‚Äî but not all that can be known like a God: universal knowledge is beyond human capacity in spite of the fact that we are making admirable progress towards knowing a vast amount; but even then we don‚Äôt operate with universal perception and we constantly have to correct for our subjective nature so everything that we do ‚Äòknow‚Äô is rather convincing and reliably demonstrable to our non-universal perception which makes it trustworthy in order to satisfy the necessities of preserving and developing beings such as ourselves ‚Äî where you see the absence of activity with respect to your incomplete set of possible actions that are observable to your non-universal perception. So, this is not proven to be the absolute absence of everything to indirectly constitute nothing which cannot be observed to begin with. Furthermore, with this ‚Äòinactivity‚Äô we have the atoms of matter vibrating regardless of life. So there is always activity with respect to matter, but with respect to functionality it is just a convincing assumption that a dead person does ‚Äî that which is beyond our grasp, forever absent in our blind spot ‚Äî nothing.

Thus, nothing is one thing that even a God *certainly doesn‚Äôt know* because if such a Supreme Being made contact with nothing, the very act of *contact* means this ‚Äònothing‚Äô is rather something! At best it‚Äôs imagined, but even then the very idea of it makes it *something* given it is unobservable, unplaceable, unassignable, indescribable‚Ä¶ unknowable: this unempty piece, capturing but the illusory *imaginary nothing*.",beatNick_,1642359976
65,awakened,Oneness is the other lesser-known side of dualism,"*People who don't understand and think they can do so without study are no different from those deluded souls who can't tell white from black.  Falsely proclaiming the Buddha-Dharma, such persons in fact blaspheme the Buddha and subvert the Dharma.  They preach as if they were bringing rain.  But theirs is the preaching of devils not of Buddhas.  Their teacher is the King of Devils and their disciples are the Devil's minions.  Deluded people who follow such instruction unwittingly sink deeper in the Sea of Birth and Death.*

*Unless they see their nature, how can people call themselves Buddhas?  They're liars who deceive others into entering the realm of devils.  Unless they see their nature, their preaching of the Twelvefold Canon is nothing but the preaching of devils.  Their allegiance is to Mara, not to the Buddha. Unable to distinguish white from black, how can they escape birth and death?*

**Bodhidharma** \[The first Zen patriarch, died 532\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Commentary and questions: It's obvious that thoughts of separation between *this* and *that* fall into the realm of dualistic thinking, but what isn't so obvious is that thoughts of 'oneness' are also squarely within dualistic thinking.  Oneness is the other side of the same dualistic coin; the true Middle Way is the subtle area and direction that lies *between* both sides, which is not easily understood or practiced.  

Read the following sentences, and watch carefully how your mind reacts to them:

*If everything is one, war is of the same value as peace.*

*If everything is one, delusion is of the same value as clarity.*

*If everything is one, a thief is of the same value as a philanthropist.*

*If everything is one, insanity is of the same value as sanity.*

*If everything is one, hate is of the same value as love.*

It should be readily apparent that these sentences aren't true; good things, as in universally accepted by most people as good, have greater value and overall merit than bad things.  So how can there actually be differing values to things if everything is one?

It is in this way that we return to the Zen teaching of *not one, not two:* there are differing values to things of course, but paradoxically there are also no differing values to anything at the very same time.  The responsibility and choice is really yours in all things, but bear in mind on the path that one shouldn't get lost in not being able to discern good from bad, or actions and consequences for those same actions.",WanderingRonin-XIII,1642358248

77,awakened,"Notes from tonight's meditation, twin souls, mirrors, meaning of life, goddess, tears with no sadness","My meditation tonight was kicked off after two songs, Puscifer- The Humbling River, and then Live - Lightning Crashes.  I really love and feel the Humbling River, and see it as referencing the awakening and our golden future.  The second song sent me into a deep cathartic cry, as my Grandmother passed away very recently, I was blessed to be by her side in the days prior.  I cried hard, and marvelled at the beauty of existence, both life and death.  After the crying subsided I could feel my crown and third eye chakras strongly active.

I put on a guided breathing meditation track, which was literally just a rhythmic breathing, which I came to notice was similar to the rhythm of breathing when falling asleep.  The breathing was deep breaths in, short quick breaths out.  It gave me cold tingles like overlapping webs at my feet, hands, and chakras, branching out into the body.  I didn't fully follow the breathing, but went with what was comfortable after the sensations really kicked in.

I could see a tunnel of small overlapping spheres as a strcture behind the other hallucinations.

I began meditating on ""no one"" seeing in my mind's eye the letters spinning around with the e remaining in place, or the e rotating around.  It highlighted the mirror nature of ""no on"" and it became a shiny mirrored visual, split down the middle.  I then shifted to ""No One is watching"", with No One now feeling like a presence.  

From there I went on to something I saw earlier today.  I saw multiple instances of 222 and 22 222 and such, followed by a car license plate that read ""2 EYES"", So I meditated on ""2 EYES"" which morphed into ""Two I's...""  I then saw a face flickering back and forth, in a hemisync like rhythm, there was a red masculine visage and a blue feminine visage.  They were also layered over each other, anywhere it was red masculine, and blue feminine still.  Then the blue entity came through very strongly.  I could really see her manifesting, for the first time, changing into various versions of herself, but always blue energy.  The goddess, Anima, the female voice which often gives me messages.  Aware of the mirror again, I asked her, ""How do you know which side of the mirror is real?""  She replied, ""They are both real, that is how a holographic fractal works"", and I was shown that my partner is absolutely and definitely, specifically my twin soul.  Our connection is very strong, and I had suspected something along these lines.  This confirmed the specific nature of our connection.

Exploring, I came across the thought of living a life and dying and having it mean nothing.  There was a visceral dark pain there, so I lingered, to clear it out.  ""Someone told you that your existence was meaningless, and part of you believed them and was very hurt.""  She said.

So I asked her ""What is the meaning of (my) life?""

After a few moments of me pondering what meaning there could possibly be, the reply, ""To truly appreciate the beauty of existence.""

I saw two oppositely spinning dark vortexes, and the eye again.  I went through the eye and the visuals became twice as vivid.

When the energy focus settles at the Sacral chakra, I can feel Love overflowing from it, filling up my body.  I also felt the full line of the root chakra, the physical lifeline of the chakra system.  If flows from the base out through the genitalia.  The third eye today was very powerfully activated, connecting all the way through in a line as well, to the well of dreams chakra in the back, which struck me as being more importantly the visual cortex.  I am searching the chakra system for an endogenous release of DMT.  The visuals are strong, but I am not certain if I have found it yet, not in the way that the Sacral chakra fills me with Love.

At some point in the middle I was feeling all three eyes equally.  It felt like all three were partially submerged in cool water.  As I continued to focus on this, I noticed tears slowly making their way down my face without any of the normal feelings or emotions associated with crying.  I could just feel the flow, and so they were flowing.

At the very end of my meditation, I was very vividly and clearly Rick Rolled by the Anima.  Cheeky, but also very sweet.",Confection_Free,1642341910
78,awakened,Christian Mysticism,"This is a glance at the topic from personal experience.

It's not every day someone comes to the sub to play up to the sales pitch of awakening. What's that? The end of suffering, a life of flow, magic, tidings of comfort and joy. It's talked about as a possibility often, but it's rare for someone to say, ""it's all real folks.""

Before getting too far into that though, it's worth noting that the good and the bad go together. And it's a process. Sometimes that process goes right through the heart of Misery Town. And there's no way to stop it, because you already signed up for the whole event.

Relationships change. Heartache becomes more pronounced. Your very sense of the world around you melts into unfathomable chaos. Bad habits and even worse ones creep to the surface and latch on like a hoard of demons. And you're somewhere in the mix of it trying to remember a mantra to keep cool. ""I am loving awareness?""

Resistance makes it much more difficult. But resisting resistance doesn't really do the trick, so you eventually let go of not letting go. Then you let go of letting go. The pendulum swings, kicked off by some recognizable but also alien force, and it's...just...all happening. 

So there's really no *honest* way to take credit for any of it. Sure, you can look at the canvas in hindsight and be like, ""well of course I did this, that and the other,"" but it's a lie. No you didn't. It happens, you're there to see it (maybe) and then it shifts. Always in motion.

The only 'real' agency as far as I'm able to tell is in imagination. This is where Christian Mysticism comes into play, and to that end, I'll bring up Neville Goddard. He's usually associated with manifestation and law of attraction.

Neville's earlier work deals with what he calls The Law. The general premise is that imagining creates reality. And, by imagining a thing to be, assuming that it is and feeling the assumption to be true, the thing comes to be, miraculously. It works. I'm sitting in a home now with my family. We've been here a year today actually, and it all happened by Grace.

The second bit, The Promise, is where Christian Mysticism kicks in. See, around the Neville started talking about The Promise, he had lost a significant amount of his following. The promise, according to him, was that man would wake up as Jesus Christ. Oh boy, here we go. Yes, here we go.

Telling someone that they can have whatever they want is appetizing. Telling them that the entire story of the Bible is about their individual awakening? That's some serious funk eye coming your way. But it's true. Jesus Christ wakes up within one's being.

It's no different from a Kundalini Awakening. In fact, they're the same thing. There's an energy surge (maybe more than one, over the course of many years) and a resulting shift in physiology. Another way to describe it is that the human body *matures* into adulthood which triggers a chemical response. How the mind generates a fiction to accommodate, well,

I like Jesus Christ. In my view, Jesus is simply the personification of Divine Intelligence. Genius. But this isn't any kind of ""genius"" that one had free agency over. In the imagination, sure. In my experience, it's become more vivid and playful. But beyond that, the only agency is spontaneity. And in that, it all simply flows.

Suddenly everything in the Bible makes sense. All the scriptures I've read countless times, having grown up in the church, have a new life to them. As does music, film, books and other texts across other religious traditions. And it all *just happened*. 

The Promise follows The Law. In fact, it's in practicing The Law, that one develops the readiness to be harnessed by Grace. (Truthfully though, Grace is working it right from the beginning, but we can pretend we *decided* to wake up and start seeking.) What is The Law? Distilled, it's being mindful. 

One's thoughts and feelings are directed by attentive practice toward whatever is most ideal. So, *all* of the practices gathered in awakening actually match. Which is to say, you're probably working The Law now. Which is also to say, The Promise is *also yours*.

Which is to say, *you are Jesus Christ*, Divine Intelligence, incarnated.

The Christian Mystic isn't satisfied with anything short of complete absolution and death in God. The path offered through Christ is a path of self-sacrifice, but more specifically, self-concept sacrifice. That's the whole symbol of the cross, on one hand. On the other, it's a surrender to that sacrifice in whole. Not my will, but thy will. And God's will is always Love.

**tl;dr**
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.

But it's been a few years and I'm finally evening out.  Some might describe it as mania with psychotic features, but to me it was something much deeper.  

I wrote a spoken word album about it, telling my story.  I was so proud of it.  I truly believe it conveyed the depth of my experience.  And admittedly, I used to listen to it A LOT.  Trying to relive it.  Trying to hold onto it.  I posted about it so much on reddit.  Trying to get other people to listen to it.  

The more time goes by, the more it just becomes words.  A story, and honestly nothing more.  The experience is gone from me.  There's no more magic in it.  The thing is about me, and I'm not special or different for this, but I'm a sober alcoholic with some mental health diagnoses.  I mention this because I have serious difficulties practicing mindfulness and meditation.  My mind wanders so hard, I live so deeply in my imagination, that I fumble every time I try.

That it, the entity, may KNOW itself to BE itself and part of the Whole; not the Whole but one WITH the whole; and thus retaining its individuality, knowing itself to be itself yet one with the purposes of the First Cause that called it, the entity, into BEING, into the awareness, into the consciousness of itself.

14. That is the purpose, that is the cause of BEING.

# Becoming aware of the First Cause. Meeting our Maker

When the mental self is loosened in the quietness of those periods when it would take cognizance of the influences about self, we find the mental as a vapor, as a gas (not that it is either, but as comparison) is loosened by the opening of the self through those centers of the body that arouse the awareness of the mental to the indwelling of the spiritual self that is a portion of and encased within self. And it, the energy, the influence - as the vapor, as the gas - rises to the consciousness within, to the temple of the motivative forces of the physical body.

29. It, that energy, seeks - by the natural law - that to which it has an affinity. Affinity is the ideal, then.

30. If that mental self, that portion of the Spirit is in accord with the Divine Will - by its application of its knowledge as to its relationships to the fellow man in the manners and purposes as indicated - there comes that consciousness, that awareness that His Spirit indeed beareth witness with thy spirit.

31. And indeed ye may then find that access, that consciousness of His abiding presence with thee that ye may carry on, ye may fulfill, ye may keep inviolate all promises that thou hast made to thy Maker; that He hath made to thee!

32. Thus it is through thine own self. For indeed thy body is the temple of the living God. It is the temple of thine own awareness. It is the temple of thine own conscious walk with Him.",JesusBuddhaKrishna,1642312997
88,awakened,love or cycle of suffering,"I started doing shrooms late 2021, I did them by being called to them by dreams, signs, the universe. I‚Äôve only done shrooms by myself, started with 2gs, then 3gs, then 5gs, then down to 2gs, then this last time which was on New Year‚Äôs Eve I did 3gs. Prior to that last one, most trips have been really intense, lot of crying, lot of suffering/healing, and it‚Äôs always left me with a very empathic view towards life, feeling light on my feet and just good clear thinking. I‚Äôve never had a trip sitter until that last trip and even then it was a over the phone trip sitter.

I met this girl on tinder, she was honestly a last minute ‚Äú will you take care of me‚Äù trip sitter. We have had some sneaky links before this and I have ghosted her before because of some stuff she would post on her private story that I did not like due to the fact she obviously loves the attention. I then add her back, knowing I just wanted to come back for more of her but telling her I just wanted space to know if she could be a good partner to be able to calm her anger down. We‚Äôve had this incident of doing it at a parking lot a while back and getting caught by security. Thankfully we weren‚Äôt reported to authorities knowing how bad the consequences were, it made me feel devasted and lonely. I had told her if she wanted to she can leave so I can just reminisce on life after what had happened. She refused to leave and stayed. This was about like 2-3 months before New Year‚Äôs Eve 

So it‚Äôs New Year‚Äôs Eve, I made an impulse decision to take shrooms knowing that in my 4th shroom trip I was given signs to wait 2 weeks before I try another trip. When In fact it had only been 3 days since my last trip. The message for the reason of waiting was basically ‚Äú I want to see more growth in you next time ‚Äú. To rationalize my impulse, I was saying growth is a state of mind and I‚Äôm sure someone has taken shrooms back to back before so what difference would it do to me.

I then take the shrooms, smoke some bud, then I realize maybe I need someone to trip sit me. I hit her up out of many people I could‚Äôve, mainly because she‚Äôs been there when I‚Äôve had felt myself at the lowest and I knew she would be able to understand me and ‚Äútake care of me‚Äù. Hours into the trip, I‚Äôm unaware of how bad the trip is until I call her and all of a sudden it felt as if the universe was putting everything together to have this moment of ‚Äú it‚Äôs okay, she won‚Äôt hurt you. She‚Äôs been through enough and wants to let you know that it‚Äôs okay to feel safe with her‚Äù. I let my gaurd, I surrender. She then asks if I feel better and I say yes. She then asks me if I‚Äôll remember anything the next day and I was pretty Lowkey out of it so I was like maybe. She then tells me never mind, and I was like okay. Knowing subconsciously I could feel her, I ask her it‚Äôs okay if she doesn‚Äôt want to say anything. She then tells me she loves me. I just start crying because behind the illusion of all these letters I‚Äôm using that y‚Äôall are putting together to be able to understand me within this illusion of materialistic/symbolic reality, is love. It‚Äôs quiet to where she feels like as if it was a  mistake to had said what she said. I then speak along the lines of making sense of it but eventually telling her ‚Äú I can say this and that but behind this illusion of reality I love you‚Äú

My last relationship I was ghosted after 17 months and it was a year ago. Absence was pain but I learned to love myself.  

The biggest thing that stuck with me for why I said I love you, is because of her presence. In a moment where I felt scared,lost, and tired of feeling alone I realized out of 7 billion people in the world she wanted to be there with me. Nothing else mattered in that present moment. 

I‚Äôm conflicted as to if this is a punishment or karma caused by myself 2x involving her. I‚Äôve only said i love you once more and not again because I don‚Äôt want to lose myself with what could be my mind. Currently working to balance my mind and heart and keep my vibrations higher. 

Some things she had told me since that I see as red flags are ‚Äú I am clingy, I get emotionally attached, since it‚Äôs a new year that means body count has reset‚Äù also vapes, drinks, apologizes a lot (Lowkey victim mentality). Shes had sexual trauma from the past which I know she‚Äôs healing from.

89,awakened,the start of my spiritual awakening ? (also clairvoyance?),"SO. I was in isolation for 7 days (covid woo). The first night I found myself in tears, feeling miserable and missing my ex. I believe this ended because my vibration was so low in survival mode (lockdown / working from home / finishing my degree from home). 

Fast forward to the next day. I decided to not respond to his message (we are still in minimal contact - we are on good terms, but that‚Äôs not the point of this) and to step away from socials. 

Whilst succumbing to temptation and scrolling on Facebook, I saw a post in a group asking if anyone knew the title of a book that was being described. I looked up key words and whilst not the book she was looking for, I stumbled upon: 

Only Love Is Real, by Dr Brian Weiss and in the suggested books;
Love is Letting Go of Fear by Gerald Jampolsky.

The preface in both books described the authors realisation that their book has always come into the lives of its readers just when they need it. 

Both of these books have completely changed my mindset - well, started the journey. My childhood experience has me pre-wired to be hyper vigilant for inconsistency and constantly primed for disappointment and I‚Äôve been in therapy to realise and address this and the emotions that have come with it. But reading these books has really shown me that I have superimposed my perception of the world with negative emotions and I‚Äôm beginning to see and feel LOVE and JOY instead of our ego-based emotions, guilt and fear. These books have shown me, personally, that religion is simply an interpretation of this LOVE. 

I have also been slowly reading ‚ÄòSapiens‚Äô by Yuval Noah Harrari. I was outside reading the chapter focusing mostly on religion, and whilst I was reading a paragraph focusing on Buddhism, I smelt a massive waft of incense. It blew my mind! The logical thinker in me thought, it‚Äôs probably a neighbour burning incense, but the rest of me thought, no way - this is a sign. I‚Äôve never smelt incense from my neighbours and as of current, nobody lives in the houses of my immediate neighbours on either side - just behind.. I hadn‚Äôt thought about it reallt since, until talking to a friend today about it who said there is some kind of clairvoyance coming through!!! Is this some sort of clairvoyance coming through?!

90,awakened,"Remember: your mind ""thinks"" like your heart ""beats"".","Think about how you describe the activity of your heart.

You might say, ""my heart is beating"", or if you're scared or excited, ""my heart is beating quickly"". Right?

You wouldn't say ""I am beating my heart"", or ""I am beating my heart quickly"".

Why? Because the heart beating is a thing that *happens*, whether or not you're exercising focused attention on it.

You can become aware of your heartbeat at any time, and you can do various practices to slow it down or speed it up, but even when you're not paying attention to it, it's still beating.

But, we always say ""I think"".

We don't say ""my mind is thinking"".

But, the mind thinking and the heart beating share more in common.

After all, we are almost always thinking, aren't we? Right now you might be thinking about these words, five minutes ago it might have been a different Reddit post, an hour before that it could be something completely different.

And were you aware of your thinking that entire time?

Were you aware of your heart beat the entire time?

No, but you could have been aware of either, if you focused your attention on it. And, by using techniques, and with practice over time, you can learn to speed up or slow either down.

Thinking is something that ""happens to us"" for most of the day, the same way the heart beats.

Remember to accept this, acknowledge it, realize that you are none of the thinking (neither the good nor the bad, but the one aware of *all* of the thinking), and treat yourself with love. Remember your true self, clear of all labels from culture and society, like an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.

So there are so many different ways to Popcorn. Everybody as far as I'm aware and care to imagine is deeply familiar with Movie Theater Popcorn. And we've all got our rituals. Like, some don't even pump the butter pump to butter the plumped up kernels. Why?

Then others are radical in their deviance. Heard a man admit once that he puts Peanut M&amp;M's in his Movie Theater Popcorn. Can you imagine? First there's, the *crunch*. Like that first burst of the Peanut M&amp;M saying, ""surprise! I'm tooth decay in a capsule!"" And you don't stop, you can't. How could you? It's a Peanut M&amp;M.

And it's like, everybody's got their own style, you know? And some like to bounce around, intermittently. Some find a groove and stick with it. Some don't know what kind of flavors they've got going on, but they've got it.

I got into an argument with my family on Jan 2nd over something that seems so ridiculous now that I'm looking back on it and had spent that whole day being emotional and angry.

My boyfriend also broke up with me out of nowhere last week when everything seemed to be going well. No problems in the relationship that would cause a sudden break up.

There is no such things as infinite darkness it is of the finite. It comes with dividing that's which was one thing into many 

So came the lower dimensions or the finite dimensions as the light which is one thing divided into many. The higher the dimension the more Light and unity. The more oneness. God is at the highest

 (Q) Just how should we explain the division of Spirit (into what we know as Good and Evil) in the spiritual realm before the earth was created? (A) God, the First Cause, in spirit, created in spirit the separate influences or forces that are a portion of, and manifested in the spirit of, God. In that essence, to become materially manifested through the evolution of the spirit of God, sin first began.

(Q) Explain how so called good and evil forces are one. (A) This has just been explained. When there is delegated power to a body that has separated itself from the spirit (or coming from the unseen into the seen, or from the unconscious into the physical consciousness, or from God's other door - or opening from the infinite to the finite), then the activity is life; with the will of the source of that which has come into being. As to what it does with or about its associations of itself to the source of its activity, as to how far it may go afield, depends upon how high it has attained in its ability to throw off both negative and positive forces.",JesusBuddhaKrishna,1642297952

101,awakened,"The Only Thing I Know for Real, and my endeavor to remember it.","Hi everyone. This is just a journal about where I've been in the past with this ""awakening"" thing, where I am now, and where I hope to be, with all my heart.

I find that right now I'm in the middle of some kind of dissolution of my identity again, and I've had a few of these over the years. I won't say I'm new to spiritual ideas or the idea of ""awakening"" or ""enlightenment"", far from it. I first started to wonder about the nature of reality when I was twelve or so, after I had a kind of epiphany about the way I was living and the dogma of my family's religion. I am twenty years old now. Twenty long years, twenty nothings, twenty blinks. And still I am a Child, always. 

My very first epiphany at that young age of twelve blossomed out of the womb of a deep fear of God. I had been afraid and I was taught to be afraid growing up, but I hadn't felt a true consuming fear like that before, not really. So I prayed. I feared the fires of Hell still. I became more stringent with my religious rituals at first. Then gradually, eventually, inevitably, my reliance on them rolled off of my back like dead skin. Something still wasn't right. 

Then the second epiphany came, and this was even more frightening. I don't know what triggered it but after I had become disillusioned with my heartless prayers, another random period of introspection came and out blasted a wave of clarity that washed over me so forcefully and so suddenly that it gave me a panic attack. And I realized, hyperventilating in my bedroom one morning, what if the way I've been taught is not the only way? What if religion wasn't everything? It's no wonder I felt so imprisoned, and in the years since that time I've realized the deep trauma that the knowledge of a judgmental God marred me with. From that point on I couldn't look back. It was time to begin the period of ""seeking"" as people would call it. As I went through high school this seeking involved my reading of any book I felt drawn to that purported to tell me what the truth of everything was (and of books I have read many, by this point). In my own brazen way I journaled about my findings in some desperate attempt to form a theory of everything, but of course I didn't really get anywhere and I soon realized I was only parroting ideas about what truth was from the lips of others, not coming to knowledge of what was Real through my own heart.

Because at some point I would understand, my moments of true and deep and resplendent clarity are thus far so precious, *so* rare.

When I enter into this state of genuine clarity it always shakes me to my core, sometimes gently, sometimes forcefully. It permeates every fiber of my being as though in the middle of a crowd of voices, past the dissonance of their announcements, I enter into a deeper silence and I hear a bell ringing loud and clear. It has the softest chime but when you hear it, you do *not* doubt. There is the ring of Truth calling. It is absolutely unmistakable. But no sooner than you hear it, you think, ""What is this sound? What about all of the voices in this crowd, calling me? The voices of my mother, my father, my friends and family? The voices of the mystics and sages? The voices of the sheikhs, the gurus, the yogis? And even my own voice? Will they not show me the way...?"" And on and on it goes. After hearing the sweet chime I suspect we are sometimes so mystified and confused, or perhaps still ever unprepared, that we return to the inner ramblings, to the feeling of heaviness and monotony that pervaded our lives just as before.

Maybe we ""awaken"" to the bell chime once or twice or three or seventeen times, but then we fall out of the state we entered. We are still in knots of confusion and in the middle of our desperate attempt to feel like we are heading somewhere, we assume that someone or something *else* rang the bell and that it wasn't ringing by itself. We attempt, many times in vain to find the one true Voice of voices in the throng of the crowd that will show us the one true path, to set us straight again. And suddenly every one and their mother and their father's grandfather's great master is out here ringing the Bell of Truth. Get it hot and spicy, with a side of love.. and light, and shadow.. *and* discipline and steadfastness and renunciation. And existential crisis.. and intoxicating *love,* once more.

When you visit enough of these bell ringers a few times and feel confused still (not by anyone's fault, really), you start to feel cheated. You are searching endlessly for the path to somewhere through the hands of some-one or some thing or some book, but in the end you realize, quietly, that you are in fact in the middle of nowhere.

That is how I feel right now. I feel like I'm in the middle of nowhere. Here I stand and look all around me and start to notice, finally, that all of these voices are calling me, but none of them ever rang so clearly as that bell. I hang my head in shame and realize where I really am. Had I heard the sweet chime of the Bell of Truth again, had I *felt* it, I would have felt it in my bones. I would have Known beyond knowing. I would not have been rambling. I can sense in some way that it's been so long since I last heard its call. Sometimes I doubt I ever did.

After a short time of wandering through my theory of everything phase in high school, I gave it up (and to be frank I don't know why I got so obsessed with it). I knew that my intelligence alone would never be enough to truly understand the mechanisms of Reality on a complete level. Not even close. It was like trying to come up with an entire science in my mind, one that only works from my point of view‚Äîand of course as a high schooler of average intelligence I was in no position to attempt that. It's a curious place to be in when you feel like in order to feel stable in yourself and your identity in the universe, you have to dissect all of it, otherwise it feels like something is going to escape you. Maybe you feel the world is out to get you, so you have to get it first. But you cannot dissect absolutely everything per se, and to do so is to live with an insatiable thirst. Same thing as feeling like you have to find the ultimate solution to saving everyone in this world, from fear, from evils. You alone are not equipped to do that. These are monstrous burdens to put upon yourself, and I learned the hard way. These burdens may also come with their own sense of damaging pride and arrogance. You might as well be Atlas carrying the world on his back. And as soon as you take a lunch break and put the universe down, it will start to meet you in its own way. It will carry you instead, and you will see how perfectly it carries All; it has always been doing that.

Anyhow, the end of one phase was just the beginning of my entry into another, and of phases I had and still have many. There was one that distracted me more than others. In comes New Age and Law of Attraction, the promise of your power to manifest, the power of the subconscious and superconscious mind, you fill in the blank. It seems that during this phase is where I completely slipped and lost the ball. I got distracted by something shiny. It's not that I don't believe in miracles, I certainly do and I always want to. But as soon as I became too enamored with these subjects in particular, I realized I had lost sight of my original goal. Not only was I not listening for the Bell, I had almost completely forgotten about it, although I was ignorant so I didn't notice I had forgotten about it. Not only that, I observed that many (not all) people in the practice of manifestation are overwhelmingly focused on their material existence and what they were yet missing in their lives, and to my chagrin I noticed the same thing had happened to me. In a desperate attempt to study from countless teachers on the art of bending reality, I began to see that I was preoccupied with reading about manifesting again and again and again.

And again.

And lo and behold, when it came down to it, I wasn't making real serious attempts at manifesting. Or at least, manifesting in tango with material reality as my only dance partner. Whenever I tried, my heart wasn't really in it. And I mean it *really* wasn't. This is what happened when I took a cold hard look at myself to see what I really cared about, and unsurprisingly many things I desired for myself suddenly became trifles‚Äîwhy had I even wanted them in the first place? I slowly began to notice it was overwhelmingly difficult, at least for me, to develop heartfelt Faith for the attainment of transitory things. But I was stubborn. I wanted to prove something to my Self, so I persisted. 

Something struck me as strange about my state of being during this point in time: here I was learning about the Kingdom of God and the promise that all things within it were at my fingertips, and yet I felt as though God was being treated as a genie in a lamp. People would speak about miracles‚ÄîMiracles!‚Äîand continue a painful slog through mud and through hell to experience them. Day after day yearnings continued. *Is the community I have become a part of in the business of manifesting or endless theorizing?* I wondered. Many of us were not, in fact, feeling it like we were experiencing the Encanto movie, yet we had our hopes that some day proof of our magic power would show itself. Some found the magic and it was bewildering, while others didn't. 

I wanted to assume that from this position as manifestor, as *soon* as I experienced a miracle, I was going to develop a deeper faith in the powers of God, Source, Spirit, Brahman, whatever name you want to ascribe to the Sacred. But no matter how much I tried at this business, I would be essentially doomed to go on for some years without being able to name one grand success. It's like I was trying to control the process of breathing, but instead of getting ""better"" at breathing, I was slowly suffocating myself. I actually felt, on a daily basis, that something had gone wrong within me, only I hadn't noticed it yet. But my heart was telling me as much.

One day I started to ask from deep within, ""Who is the one that is doing the manifesting? Who lives? Who breathes? Who creates?"" and then I noticed truly *for the first time*, and overwhelmingly, that it wasn't ""Me"", not that voice in my head, not my formed Identity. Something shattered. And then I started to realize, with some humor, why almost all manifesting teachers in existence will tell you ultimately to let go. I realized that the essence of what the manifesting masters teach had been escaping me the entire time, although I couldn't cognize it because of my own preoccupied Self.

I'm told I am a creator of my reality, I am told to persist and to hold my vision, then I am told to let go of what is being created. When I really meditated on this, I found such a glaring contradiction here. Yet that contradiction, I daresay, is the essence of the way manifestation in general is taught. If it is the ""letting go and letting God"" that leads to a desire manifest, then what business have I trying to be *manifestor*? It's so easy to get caught up in this role of being manifestor, and if you have gotten into this too and find that manifesting has become a great vexation for you, perhaps you should now try to step back and deeply observe why. For me, I felt that my obsession with the identity of being ""manifestor"" lost me my connection with the One who Manifests. In fact, I had all but forgotten about the One who Manifests, although I was speaking and reading about them almost every damn day. If you are someone who has gotten caught up in this too, I am not saying there is anything wrong with it. But I implore you to look deep within your heart now. Do you feel the true presence of Faith there, of any magic? Or are you slogging through mud? Are you cursing yourself with your desires?

This doesn't have to be about manifesting either (some of you, I know, will abhor my bringing up this topic), it could be about absolutely any ritual or ""spiritual"" habit you have gotten yourself into. It was time for me to realize, with some humiliation, that my current habits were getting me nowhere closer to living and appreciating the already present miracles of life. Rather they were leading me into complications, as if I had started to perform surgery on an already healthy body. I had to cease all activity, release my obsessions, and enter into a period of reflection.

We human beings have an extraordinary talent for holding on. My talent for holding on, during this phase of my journey, became the only miracle I had created by far. I spoke about the Divine every day but I really *had* forgotten about God, and the chime of that sweet Bell of remembrance they sounded to me once. My life was once again, as I saw it, incomplete. Fragmented. Aimless. As a sort of balm for what I felt to be the burning arrogance of my Self, I began to repeat at random times during the day, ""I and the Father are one, yet I do nothing of my Self. I and the Beloved are one, yet I do nothing of my Self."" I entered the period of attempting Self-transcendence for lack of a better word, which in and of itself may prove to be another preoccupation, a distraction from What Is. The names I gave to the Nameless didn't matter, but in those moments regaining my humility did. I had cursed myself and my experience of life in the pursuit of my desires, which for me personally, were of no true benefit to my being. Out of all of the traits I suppose would Save me in this life, it would be humility. It has always served me well. 

I resolved that I would hear the Bell of Truth once again, and do everything in my power, and I mean *everything*, to answer its call. I cannot help but do everything to answer. If I must walk on the razor's edge of search and surrender, then I will. Through hell and high water and through the slog, through forgetfulness and remembrance, I will answer the call. Nothing compares to the ineffable love, and the music, and the glory of the Beloved. I hope to see Her face everywhere I look, and feel Him within everything I am, some day. And that day will always be Now, never tomorrow. All my desperate attempts at escape and preoccupation have done for me was to cause me to trip back into the arms of the One who was always holding me. Whether I want to call my distractions material or spiritual doesn't matter; all paths I have taken thus far have led me back to the deep crevasse of longing in my heart that is still there. Still knocking. And if it is still there, it means I am not yet where I need to be. I have not yet passed through the threshold of this Great Door. I am still trying to carry this world, and I have not yet embraced the One who carries me. Even my sense of the spiritual and the Godly has so far meant nothing, if I cannot feel God yet in my spirit. It is nothing. 

And all of the voices of this world, while they speak in many a convincing language, have become not the Truth, but still these.. outlines. Still empty shapes. And now they are all still just God's Bell ringing ceaselessly. Calling.. calling. 

There is only one thing I can know for Real. 

If you connect to my experience at all and want to understand where you are now, to understand if you are any closer to knowing Spirit beyond knowing, call upon your humility. Call upon your honest Heart. That is where Faith is born. It will show you where you are.

109,awakened,Victim or creator?,"There are only two types of behavior. The first one is the position of the victim. Most people are playing this role in their life. To be a victim means to shift responsibility to someone else, to life, to God, etc. When something unexpected happens we usually get mad/upset. We try to find someone to blame to make life easier for us. When you have someone to blame you literally don‚Äôt have to do anything except to sit and wait for help to come or just cry without taking any actions. It is a very good way to manipulate people as well. But also people don‚Äôt realize how much suffering they bring to themselves and to their close ones by this kind of attitude. Because when you live that way you get disappointed by every little thing that goes ‚Äúwrong‚Äù , at least in your opinion. And usually if you feel strong enough, you start to struggle with the world to change it. It is hard to accept the reality as it is when you play a victim role. I‚Äôm not saying that life is all about accepting but when it comes to past traumas the best thing to do is to accept, to say Yes it happened to me but I need to move on. It is useless and painful to resist your past since you can‚Äôt change it. The more you do that the more depressed you get. 

The other type of behavior is a creator of your life. The creator takes responsibility for everything that happens in his life. Our subconsciousness forms all  the circumstances in life , even when you get robbed or your car gets stolen. Everything happens for a reason. We all have psychological traumas. Basically they come from unaccepted situations (victim position). The more pain we carry the more ‚Äúbad‚Äù circumstances we attract. These traumas stay in our bodies as energy blocks. So one of the purposes of the subconsciousness is to help us to get rid of them to help our health, to help us to live the pain through, to let it go. That‚Äôs why we call toxic people our teachers. The other purpose of subconsciousness is to make us grow the fastest way. Each of us came to this world to get a specific experience which will give you the fastest spiritual growth (which has nothing to do with religion) and eventually to exit the samsara. Someone may even come here as disabled person, that is not bad or good, it is just what they needed in this carnation and it was their choice. 

The creation is made like there is no one else here besides you. You may say that there other people live around but if you look at it from a higher perspective everything is one and this oneness is you. So there is no one here to blame. You are everything and everybody else is your continuation, your life is a mirror of your internal world. And you are responsible for every circumstance in your life.

Let's explore why this happens.,"Consciosuness is to be used it's an active source for creative forces or spiritual energy to find an expression in the physical. Individuality is as its own creative force in this universe. Its purpose is to draw from spirit and direct it. 

The mind can attune to nothing and get nothing or draw from it's spiritual source and be as a channel for that energy to find an expression in this universe. 

So why does a Buddhist never experience the opening of the third eye? Its because they have shut off their own creative force. Its inactive. The spirit cannot arise and flow through a closed channel. 

Those who know consciousness is connected to the universal forces and creative forces of life know they can attune and bring forth a way to proactively manifest those forces as they direct it. 

This allows the third eye to open. You meet God face to face there as Edgar Cayce says. 

You open the door to the divine within. You attune and connect and the energy centers open up to allow the creative forces which is God to manifest through you

&gt;It can be very difficult for any spiritual teacher to get through to students like this, to get them to stop holding on to their fixation on an absolute view.

It is actually the ego that fixates on the absolute in this way, using it as an excuse for dismissing unenlightened behavior, thought patterns, and divided emotional states. As soon as we grasp at any view, we have gone blind to everything else.

Like in real life. He had many lifetimes until he conquered himself and overcame this world. He was the first.

According to Cayce he was the first man to go through complete ascension from an earthly man to a heavenly man. 

# Jesus was woke

He knew all mankind has one source. There is one Father of all creation... That which gave life to all mankind. That which willed this life and that which all being-ness happens in and through. He called his Father of creation and all mankind.. Spirit. Jesus knew our very beingness arises from spirit and that man and God are as one being in truth. 

So he was awakened to the oneness of life. He knew we all have one Father and he also knew our Father wills that we all live as one body. And the goal is for mankind to be as Gods body or companion and the body for the Father Spirit to fully dwell in.


His awareness was simply the oneness of life. And that our being-ness happens in and through a greater being. 

# His method

To connect with source or the Father of life his method was to completely surrender his entire being to this Spirit. And act as a Temple for him to use. 

According to Cayce his favorite prayer was Not my wall but thine will be done in and through me. This kept him in a surrendering spirit so that God can use him. He also used others Lord others.. Here I am use me. Which kept him also in a servant to others spirit. This creates the vibrations of selflessness so that God may fully dwell in him. To the degree that he spoke Gods words not his own. 

This is what union between God and man looks like. And its the reason why man exists.

According to Cayce awakening is a conscious effort of using your entire beingness to attune to God which he referred to as Creative Forces.

That space within awareness which is soulful. Eckhart Tolle who, mind you, always looks like he's about to go fishing but forgot his hat, he calls it the *pain body*. Feelings. You hurt my feelings. What's that like?

Knowing that soulful place is really knowing yourself in a non-linguistic sort of way. It isn't something that needs to be thought *about*. It, you, the feelings, is.

While I‚Äôm still a novice in many ways, I have studied daoism, hinduism (mostly Advaita Vedanta &amp; tantra), buddhism, paganism, wicca, Kabbalah, tarot, crystals, but mostly I have done a lot of mediating. I also endlessly lectured and implored my partner to join me, to no avail. Finally, after a year of study, my lonliness, lack of significant progress, and some simultaneous life things combined into one big trigger for a dark night of the soul. I‚Äôm mostly out but still kinda recovering, good news tho is that me dropping all my spiritual practices and becoming suicidal actually triggered my partner to have their ""come to god"" moment and now we are working together! üòÇ Its been a few months since that, and we have been reading, meditating, and watching videos every day. 

But now, sadly it seems like life has come in with another curveball and is sending us back to work. But our lives have changed so much in the past few years, we have no idea what to do! 

I've made some progress on a youtube channel, but obviously that's no guarantee, and generally takes a good deal of time to get off the ground so we certainly need something in the meantime. 

We both are very skilled, good at dealing with people and working with our hands/bodies. We are good at cooking, music,  public speaking, and have lead many people before. We would love to be somewhere where we could serve our community, spend lots of time together, learn more about spiritual practice, and find community. We aren't specific to any one spiritual practice (although we are non-dualist), we just wanna love God &amp; serve the people. Thanks for your advice!",livelist_,1642227667

135,awakened,Substance Use &amp; Masturbation,"*Note: this post is for encouraging awareness &amp; not to shame any behaviour or habit*

This post is being made as a caution to all of us to be aware of the intentions behind every habit and behaviour we partake in. Especially ones such as substance use and masturbation which are two primary places of dependence and habitual clinging, craving and *addiction*.

As relying on any substance is dependence, and clinging to the sensual pleasures of masturbation is self-indulgence.

However, for those that are strong proponents of masturbation and many daily and weekly masturbators are, masturbation can serve a purpose by showing to us that there is no need to feel shame, guilt or judge ourselves for simply experiencing the sensations of the body. So do not take the above sentence as a shaming statement.

However, if one really wants to dive deep into the nature of reality and experience the fullness of the subtle sensations and profound ineffable nature, be very aware of what one clings to and continually partakes in habitually. As once it becomes a daily thing... be very very conscious of ones intentions. As this can be a place of falling into unconscious tendencies that perpetuate a clinging-craving-aversion cycle, that is suffering.

To fully ground into the *here &amp; now* as pure awareness we have to *remain equanimous*. Which means being complete without clinging, craving or aversion.

Be very aware, as some of us may get very defensive at the idea we have to give up smoking or masturbating and claim these things are beneficial. But just the very fact the ego gets defensive about it shows that there needs to be more awareness present in that space.

Anyways, there are a lot of words here and enough was said.

137,awakened,An Ultimate secret key to Wealth,"God wants you to be wealthy. God has made you wealthy on the inside; society has made you believe that you are not. This widespread delusion of scarcity is one of the principle reasons for desire and attachment. This is a big lie that is designed to keep you chained down. Belief in a limited supply is what keeps you running on your hamster wheel, chasing after that which can never complete you. Belief that there is never enough becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

An ultimate secret to breaking Free of this idea of scarcity that society has conditioned upon you is the concept of abundance. What is abundance? Abundance is not about having enough of what you need, but in having more than enough. This is the realization and understanding that having more than enough is not wasteful, but rather it is an ideal mindset. When you firmly engrain this concept deep within you, it becomes the lens through which you experience life. This perspective magnetizes you to not only attract abundance in all aspects of your life, but that effect ripples outward, inspiring others to join this lifestyle with you.

When wealth manifests for you in this way, you are less attached because you don't measure yourself by what outer wealth you have. Instead, you recognize that the material abundance is just a manifestation of the internal abundance that already exists deep within your core of authenticity. Experiencing this means that you can never be poor again, because this inherent richness is immortalized in your spirit.",realAtmaBodha,1642218162

139,awakened,Anti(dote)-Social,"Audaciously rebellious responses to absurd social standards that have been evolving for far too long.

Physical definitions are just that, and nothing else, there is no argument about that: so why is there abuse? We abused them into social standards that if violated results in a negation of the natural variety of being human. We are absurd to ourselves socially like when we tell someone to man-up! As if there is a better way, the proper way for him to be a man according to your bias, your prejudice, or your non-universal expectations ‚Äî many if not all of which were given to you; did you even think about them for yourself? Or did you just go out of your way to operate on behalf of these givens until they programmatically became ‚Äòyours‚Äô? ‚Äî as ‚Äòthe standard‚Äô by which to measure ‚Äòman‚Äô and ‚Äòup‚Äô. But can you even explain this standard you were given? Or only do it, see it, and bark about it not being there? Should you even impose it if you respect freedom? And if you respect freedom, doesn‚Äôt that suggest other standards? As it is, when we see significant rebellion against these social standards then we run back to the original physical definitions to (subconsciously?) defend our social standards which were just an abuse of the physical definitions to begin with! So we never had proper respect for the physical definitions by making them do what they cannot possibly support ‚Äî for instance, we have a double-edged sword called ‚Äòbitch‚Äô for when a man is acting like a woman, and a woman is acting like a man, as if physical definitions and social standards somehow form a reasonable unity reflecting the way a human is meant to be ‚Äî and then we want to throw these definitions in the face of the rebellion to make them look ridiculous for not respecting physicality which we ourselves already don‚Äôt respect properly! All of a sudden the way we treat the physical definitions matter when the rebellion abuses them as well. But if we really respect the physical definitions then we would treat our social standards as what they really are ‚Äî mere interpretations we made up for anyone who would concern themself ‚Äî out of respect for not just the limitations of the physical definitions ‚Äî my genitalia isn‚Äôt meant to manifest any additional characteristics regardless of correlations which may very well speak far more to the generations of social reinforcement which you cannot isolate from biological tendencies because both factors are continually interacting ‚Äî but also the thousands of ways and more to be a human regardless of your demographic. As opposed to thinking it‚Äôs absurd that others rebel against the social fictions that you were given which may still be convenient to your prejudice, bias, non-universal perception, unawareness, stubbornness, or denial but they are really just merely conventional and spoiled: social standards poisoning the well of what it means to be human because you‚Äôd rather settle for ‚Äòyour‚Äô overreaching agreement over our human nature‚Äôs degrees of freedom. 

Perhaps that‚Äôs our core problem. We lack respect for individual liberty, for freedom itself in ‚ÄòThe Land Of The Free‚Äô because subtly shifting social standards seduce us every step of the way in our ever-changing ‚ÄòThe Way It Is‚Äô. We assume that a system based on respecting freedom ‚Äî which means not abusing freedom as that would make it into a vice which would then call for restrictions out of respect for freedom; as opposed to restrictions from predetermined classifications of continuous activity under do‚Äôs and don‚Äôt‚Äôs ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt work in our madman game of sustaining, shuffling, adding, subtracting, manipulating, and reviving rules thereby leaving us with a game that‚Äôs always changing; so is it even a game? And if you violate our schizo-game by ‚Äòunqualified‚Äô means then you‚Äôre the crazy one. Welcome to our rearranging and overreaching agreement that is society to pursue uncertain advantages in spite of possible disadvantages; both of which we can only place fluctuating materialistic valuations on and even then they‚Äôre both holding, changing, fragmenting, and (re)generating.

140,awakened,Nonduality without Heart is logical conclusion.,"And that's okay. 

(sorry. i come from a generation that grew up on aesthetic listicles. like goth meets buzzfeed.)

And that's okay. 

Anyway, Nonduality as a concept is straightforward and allows for one to identify with a logical conclusion. I don't exist as a separate entity. All there is, is the indivisible ""I"" experiencing itself. Cool. Solid doctrine. Easy. Setup your King (identity) and shift the board, logically, to the obvious conclusion.

Over and over and over again. Even if it means spiritual bypassing. But that's another conversation.

This conversation is for the seeker who's not yet done seeking. Like, you get it. It's solid. Yes. But there's this nagging, I don't know what to call it. Y'know? Otherwise, why would you be reading this?

Can it all simply be dismissed as delusion? Is that *really* what feels most true? What ""all"" is being referred to?

The playthings of the dream world. Beliefs.

If it's worked it's way through, Non-dual*ism* has sufficiently cracked the code of identity. It's not attached to any specific thing. Well done. You beat the game. Bravo.

But now that you've won, what's next?

Reset the board, Maestro.

You already know logically that you're not the you which you think you are. That's verified in direct experience. Otherwise, you wouldn't have read this far. But here you are now, completely vested in *what's next*?

That is *completely* up to you. You can't *lose* Nonduality. Haha. You can't lose the game. What *feels* like the next best step? Make it. No questions. And then after that, what *feels* like the next best step? Make it. No questions. And then after that, what *feels* like the next best step? Make it. No questions. And then after that, what *feels* like the next best step? Make it. No questions.

And then after that? You look at your life and how it unfolds and begin noticing a story being told. Beliefs trail behind you, dropping out of the bosom of your own heart-felt wisdom. They become the crumbs that others along the way can follow to freedom or liberation or contentment or whatever the high ideal is.

These beliefs are articulated as need be in conversation or in simple gestures, all of which is out of your personal control. Life shifts and adjusts to playing the game crossdimensionally. 4D Chess. Your environment morphs and adjusts in response to You, in Total.

And when this habit builds to intuit your way through life,

It's no longer a question. There is no choice. You already know what you need to do.

159,awakened,Unconditional love,"If you want to reach enlightenment you have to continually make a choice. The good news is there is no wrong answer and you can always change your mind. But there are tradeoffs to each choice.

What is more frightening to you, or said inversely, which do you believe in more? That the being, deity, force (however you want to define it) the thing that cannot be defined with mere words that created the universe, loves the entirety of the universe unconditionally or there are conditions to Its love.

Most religions hold up an ideal of some kind of unconditional love, but in practice there are conditions to reaching unconditional love. There is a heaven and hell. There is good or bad. God has favorites or chosen ones, meaning there are by definition unchosen ones or less than favorites. Or you will get it in your next lifetime. So it isn't unconditional love.

There is purpose to humanity putting conditions on God's love. Our collective ego, our survival depends on incentivizing collective action. We couldn't have or appreciate the miracles of modern society or be exchanging these thoughts on the internet without a history rich with putting conditions on God's love.

But what if I told you there is another way. Put duality aside for a second, not to negate it, you can and will out of necessity of life have to return to it, that is unavoidable. But just put duality aside and consider that True unconditional love from God is real.

Here are those tradeoffs to consider though. Unconditional love for the entirety of the universe by its creator is a belief that can live in you. It in fact already does. But to practice and live it you have to deprogram some of the duality defaults in your mind. Unconditional love means there is no good or bad. All are loved equally. 

To walk and know unconditional love you have to love all equally. Doesn't mean you have to accept or approve of evil and suffering in how you conduct your affairs. But you have to accept that God put that evil and suffering there with as much purpose as you. And if all are loved unconditionally then there can't be a hell. There can be a heaven, but all are welcome when they are ready to walk and know unconditional love.

Ok that's enough heavy thought. Ponder it. Don't worry about it. One second you can believe in unconditional love and the next you'll see something that reminds you of the thought, no Hitler must be burning in Hell right now, he has to be right? Unconditional love is scary stuff. But there is nothing more rewarding, and it is already within us.

There is no far away distances either.  The rules of Physics that God the source dreamed up is the reason why we think there is time and there is distance.  We're just a dream of God.  God dreamed us up.

The rules of physics and the world we know and mathematics are real to us because it is what God dreamed up.  How do we know there aren't other rules outside of what God dreamed up for us?

165,awakened,Oneness is bliss! Non-duality is way and love!," Welcome friend :)

Now  that I have caught your attention, and we all know that the disease of  today's man is a chronic lack of attention, I want to serve you some  mental food. Since most people today do not pay attention to read more  than a few lines, I will try to write this as briefly and concisely as  possible, although I know I will not succeed in doing so. But it doesn't  matter, let reading this text be a test, an exercise in attention and  concentration.

I'll be honest  right away. I chose this title just to appeal to you because I noticed  that non-duality philosophy is very popular and appealing to everyone  and I noticed that it has become like some new religion. If you say  something against it, you will immediately be marked as an amateur on  the spiritual path. Since I have always been a rebel and a heretic, so  even now I have to raise my voice against generally accepted norms, that  is, try to explain the philosophy of non-duality from my limited  understanding.

I believe that the  philosophy of non-duality is true, but simplified truth. This is why it  is so popular today, because of the general state and mind of the  average man, a man who can read only a few sentences, the truth must be  simplified so that man can chew it. I think that's good too, I just  wanted to shed light on some more aspects of this doctrine.

There  have been mystics in all cultures and at all times who have understood  and experienced the truth of non-dualism. Their experiences are quite  similar; the terminology with which they tried to express their  knowledge is slightly different, which is quite understandable. The  problem can only arise because this experience is difficult to convey  accurately to those who are not conversant with it. Thus, we have cases  where many mystics were killed and considered heretics because they knew  and made public this understanding. For example, Islamic  traditionalists killed Mr. Mansur Al-Hallaj who is best known for his  saying: *I am the Truth* *(Ana'l-·∏§aqq)*,  which many saw as a claim to divinity, while others interpreted it as  an instance of annihilation of the ego, allowing God to speak through  him (also some of his statements are: *If  you do not recognize God, at least recognize His sign, I am the  creative truth because through the truth, I am eternal truth. There is  nothing wrapped in my turban but God, there is nothing in my cloak but  God*). He also wrote: *I saw my Lord with the eye of the heart. I asked, 'Who are you? 'He replied,' You '.*

Didn‚Äôt Jesus also declare: *I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.*

Also mystics who have transmitted their experiences through ancient Vedic texts in the form of Upanishads have stated: *Aham Brahmasmi* (I am Brahman or Divine), *This Self (Atman) is Brahman*, *Tat Tvam Asi*  (That Thou Art - that you are). From this knowledge of the Upanishads  arose a very popular philosophical-spiritual school of Vedanta called  Advaita (monisam, non-doulazim). According to this doctrine *Moksha*  (liberation from suffering and rebirth) and immortality is attained  through disidentification from the body-mind complex, and acquiring *vidyƒÅ* (knowledge) of one's true identity as *Atman-Brahman*, self-luminous (*svayam prakƒÅ≈õa*) Awareness or Witness - consciousness.

Also  from the same writings, since everyone interprets certain things in  accordance with their current level of being, the school of Dvaita  (dualism) emerged. The Dvaita Vedanta School believes that God and the  individual souls (*jƒ´vƒÅtman*) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct, being said that *Vishnu (Narayana)* is independent, and souls are dependent on him.

Between these two extreme views, there is a third, which unites both and this philosophical thought is called ***Achintya-Bheda-Abheda (inconceivable one-ness and difference)*** and my understanding of this doctrine is the subject of this post.

The philosophy of *Achintya-bheda-abheda*  includes elements of both of the above viewpoints. The living soul is  intrinsically linked to the Absolute, and yet at the same time is not  the same as the Absolute - the exact nature of this relationship being  inconceivable to the human mind. The Soul is considered to be part and  parcel of the Absolute. Same in quality but not in quantity. Absolute  having all opulence in fullness, the spirit soul however, having only a  partial expression of its divine opulence. Absolute in this context is  compared to a fire and the souls as sparks coming off of the flame.

By  the way, I am a big supporter of the golden rule of middle path in  everything, that is, balance and harmony between extremes. Isn't that  the teaching of our friend Mr. Buddha? I think I read an anecdote  somewhere how while sitting with the disciples a pious gentleman  approached him and asked him: *Is there a God?* It is said that the Buddha replied: *God does not exist.* The man went home sad. Then another man who was an atheist approached him. He asked the same question. The Buddha replied: *God is the only thing that exists.*  From this example we can see that it is not important whether God  exists or not, but it is important to get rid of the conditioning of our  mind. That is why I am writing this post. We need to get rid of the  conditioning that the idea of unity has caused in our minds, although it  is very difficult not to cling to some other idea. I think that in the  end we should leave all the books and formulas, teachers and masters,  and look at life directly through our eyes in the present moment. Much  easier said than done. This remind me of the story of Mr. Rumi and the  great mystic Shams al-Din, who according to tradition, threw all Rumi's  books into the water and said: *Now is the time to live your life directly*.

I think that Mr. Lao Tzu in his work *Tao Te Ching* very poetically and beautifully presented the nature of reality: *The  nameless is the source of heaven and earth. It is called the mother of  all things. Let us consider his unmanifested secret with a calm spirit.  With the aroused spirit let us look at its manifested forms. The two are  the same in source and different in expression. That they are the same  is a secret, a secret above secrets, a door to these secrets.*

By  the way, I think that the term Tao is the most poetic and appropriate  to represent this miracle that we are all part of, but in order not to  sound sectarian to someone, I will use the neutral expression Absolute  in the following text.

There are  only a few, conditionally speaking, basic laws of existence. The first  and most important is the Law of One. All religions and great  philosophical systems actually serve to present this truth to the common  man, whose brain functions on the principle of duality, and who sees  duality in everything (hot/cold, night/day, life/death, good/bad,  god/devil, etc.), that is, human brain see the manifestation of only two  forces of the Absolute.

The  Absolute in the unmanifested state is pure unity and bliss. When that  Absolute, because of his free will and fun, wants to create various  universes, that is, to manifest itself, then the law of trinity comes on  the scene. Unity is manifested as three forces that create all  phenomena, from atoms to the universe. Each force has all the properties  of the Absolute; it only performs a different function. The name of  these forces is not important, but to make it easier to understand, they  can be called active, neutral, passive, or positive, neutralizing and  negative (not negative as something bad, but more in magnetism, positive  and negative poles). Active force is in charge of creation, neutral for  maintenance, and passive for destruction. This is at the core of every  phenomenon. In the Vedic scriptures these forces are metaphorically  represented as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. In Christian terminology the  three forces of the Absolute are represented as the Father, the Son and  the Holy Spirit. Active force can be represented as a male principle,  while passive as a female principle (Jing/Jang).

The  problem is that man in his conditioned, or dormant, state is not aware  of the third neutral force. They say this is because the third force is  the property of the Real World. The human brain in all phenomena only  notices two opposing forces, while it does not notice the balancing  force. Third force actually make possible that any phenomenon exists.  Man is blind to the third force and that is his misfortune.

In  essence, there is nothing but the Absolute and the interaction between  its various energies. That is why there are no enemies, nor is there a  need for any fear. It is oneness/unity or non-dualism. We, human beings,  are also one of those energies that is qualitatively the same as the  Absolute. This is well represented by the Vedic story that the Absolute  is like all air that exists, and we are currently air in a closed  vessel. We have the same chemical composition. When the vessel breaks in  some way, we unite with all the air that stands. He who understands  this truth can enjoy its fruits even while he is living in vessel, it  doesn't matter.

At the moment, we  as Absolute are in a manifested state. We were unmanifested, and now we  are manifested. That is the essence of the beauty of human life. If we  want to be in harmony and happiness, we must see our true position in  the cosmos and act in accordance with it. The unmanifested Absolute  wished to manifest in innumerable forms in order to experience itself in  different ways. The Vedas say that this universe is just one of the  many pastimes of God of which we are a part. So let's have fun!

Although  the life force is the same in each of us, no one is the same. That‚Äôs  the beauty, otherwise there would be no need for so many shapes and it  would be boring. In the manifested state, although everything is one,  everything is at the same time individual and different (inconceivable  one-ness and difference). There are no two same leaves, two same clouds,  let alone two same human beings. That is our value. We are very rare  and unique, and everything that is rare is valuable. And yet we are all  the same.  I don't think there is any need to rush to return to the  unmanifested state, because otherwise what is the purpose of manifesting  this now life we live? We need to fulfill our destiny and live this  human life to the fullest as a human being. That is why we have chosen  this present form. To experience through it all that man is. The problem  only arises because man is born in the company of sleepers and in the  environment they have created and which supports this hypnotic dream.  Therefore, another meaning of the practice of self-remembering is to  remember who are we really while living this life, where we came from  and where we are going. To become aware of our true nature, to enjoy  this game without identifying with it. Probably many of you have played  or are playing video games. Let's say you play an RPG game and identify  with the character in it so that you forget about your real existence.  That's how something happens in real life. Remember yourself, always and  everywhere!

Something  I can't help but notice is the chronic lack of passive power in the  world, that is, the lack of authentic female energy. There are many  reasons for this; of course one of them is the influence of patriarchal  society through the centuries. Feminine energy is sacred and the mother  Earth simply longs for its manifestation. Look at the state of our  planet: pollution, destruction, wars. All this speaks of an imbalance  between the male and female principle. Women, if you haven‚Äôt already,  break free! Don‚Äôt imitate men, but be real women, authentic, I know it‚Äôs  your nature to act from the shadows, and act, but be what you are.  Feminine energy means compassion, maintenance, care and concern. The  same goes for men, be the bearers of the true masculine principle, not a  surrogate. Perhaps then a true understanding and manifestation of the  third force arises between men and women. Take a look at this *sub*  sometimes objectively and you will see an imbalance between the  manifestations of masculine and feminine nature. Only men compete,  quarrel, argue over who is right, whether or not there is a God and the  like.

In the end, I want to say  that love is a force that in this manifested state can connect us with  the unmanifested Source and everything that exists, and that is the way  in which we can feel the unity of everything. Not abstract love, like  love for all people, love for the world, but concrete living love. You  love the one who is closest to you, and that is you. Love the animals,  the plants you meet, love the people you meet every day (*Love your enemies*).  The most important place you can be is where you are right now; the  most important person in your life is the one you are currently with.

I will end with one story from the life of the mystic Ramanujacharya.

One of the greatest devotees of India, Ramanuja, passed through a village. A man approached him and asked him: *I want to be initiated by you. I want to find God. I want to develop a love for God.* Ramanuja replied: *Tell me one thing first. Have you ever loved someone in your life?* The man said indignantly: *I am not interested in that superficial kind of love. Love between people. I want to feel true love, love of God.* Ramanuja cried and was very saddened by the fate of this man, and said to him: *Go  back to life and love someone, wife, friend, or child. Only after you  manage to love man, then you will learn what it means to love God.*

170,awakened,How polarity works.. Darkness is not the Light.. it's the absence of it.. God is not the polarity,"Polarity is not God. Polarity is how God manifests.

Yes he is the Darkness and the Light ""only"" as related to how he bears witness with creation. Its more proper to say God creates the darkness and the light.

# How this works

God is Spirit= my Spirit bears witness with your spirit. This is as God in action.  God says as you sow shall ye reap.

You want to kill others.. I bear witness..  there is a dimension for that... Here you go. 

This is God in action. The source being the source of life. 

And there are highest dimensions reserved for full alignement (of pure light) and many dimensions reserved for misalignment (absence of light) And there are also middle dimensions where they intermix. We are here. (Polarity) in the lukewarm dimension. 


We have our life here. God is only bearing witness with what our soul group chose. 



# Summary

God is not polarity but he creates polarity so that you can be a free will being and be wherever that takes you as a soul having your life in God. 


# God the being is Light and only Light. 

This is the side of God many of you need to explore. It is much better than the God is everything many of you are exploring which is incorrect. Which leads to thinking God is the darkness and the light as a being...

God the being is the author of life. The presence of light. The same pure light as those in NDE describe. The Father of life. The source of life. The fullness of light. 

He has a will. God wills that the light remain present in all it's sparks. Those Sparks are you. It radiates from it's source. 

You are sparks of lights within the Light. This is the God you should get to know. God the being. 



Trust in those who've been there. God is the light. A sure way of knowing this is to open the door to God within. Go raise your vibrations in self and explore these dimensions. Leave the body. Go into the light. You will come to the same conclusion many who've had NDE say. God is the Light.",JesusBuddhaKrishna,1642140946

And this surrender, this denial to the extreme of the immolation of the &lt;I&gt;, makes one realize that in truth everything that happens comes from that unique power and aims at the achievement and preservation of the Universal Good.

199,awakened,becoming addicted to becoming more awakened?,"Hi!
I think my awakening started around a year ago when I learned that my wife is a narcissist and she has an affair. I kicked her out, divorced and set my intention of cleaning up my whole life that lead to myself putting up in an emotional abuse relationship. Eckhart Tolles work brought me on the topic of awakening. Being instead of thinking. This started it all. Together with working with psychedelics (~once a month). Things got better and I got more and more into the spiritual works of e.g. Alan watts. I started meditating.
I am doing yoga for around half a year. One month ago I started to intensify my practice (4-5 yoga classes each 1.5 hours per week) because I learned that yoga lets me be, rathe than think all the time (some may call this enlightenment?). It made me stop using weed daily (to the point where the only some occasions I used it, I actually thought later that being sober would be more fun).
After yoga classes I feel amazing, I get into a no mind state, where I can look at my traumas and process them on a cognitive level and it also keeps on being more present in my daily life, the awareness, simply being.


A friend of mine told me that I should be careful not to switch an addiction for an addiction. But yoga doesn't feel that way for me. There is never a regret doing it (well weed was also super nice in the beginning). I spend my evenings in the yoga studio strengthening my body and mind instead of getting high and binging netflix. I got a new connection to my body and can somehow feel what food is good for me and what not. I have a desire to eat healthy and lost ""lust"" for unhealthy fatty food that I used to love. I stopped drinking alcohol because I do not like the buzz anymore, similar to weed. (Still into occasional, ritualy used psychedelics). I like to spend time with myself. I am in the best bodily shape as I have ever been, yet I am simply happy about it and not arrogant (as I was when I hit the gym 3 times a week years ago). I feel happier than I have ever been. I like my job more and procrastinate less.
I do however meet less friends..but mostly those people where there is only small talk about things that pull me down....coronavirus, the planet going to waste....people with whom there is never any sort of deep talk, people who do not have a passion for anything. People who binge watch YouTube and Netflix and not even have a passion about it (like love to talk about it)....

Inside of myself I feel that I have found i higher standard for myself. A higher level of being. And some people cannot understand this/are afraid because it confronts them with their own problems. That those cannot change the trajectory of their lives.

Is this awakening? The need to go on when you saw what life can be? Not being satisfied with standing on a point in live? Thinking of my life as the adventure it is?

I will talk with this friend about what he meant with this when I see him the next time...but I guess it is because because I get ""strange""...a hippie Yogafreak, talking about philosophical stuff üòÅ

Maybe I only write this because my traumatized ego still looks for reasons I do not deserve to be happy...I am a little afraid that I want to escape my trauma by awakening. Maybe this sounds silly to you, but I have no one to talk about this stuff. Don't roast me to hard ü§ó",xandi1990,1642084816

209,awakened,Portrait of a man named Jesus,"Worship who you want or no one at all. The point of this post is to reflect on a perspective about Jesus, loosely based on the synoptic text.

Ready? K.

Jesus is this kid of Joseph and Mary that showed up out of nowhere. Mary was pregnant, but apparently Joseph didn't get to know her that way before it happened. Y'know? So that's the circumstance. 

Jesus is growing up as the mystery kid of a young couple, and they're trying to make ends meet. As a family. Joseph, he's a Craftsman. An artisan, really. Well, he'd be a *famous* artisan if he didn't live in some backwater small-town called Nazareth. He had *dreams*, you understand? He wanted to *be somebody*. Then Mary said, ""Joe, we gotta talk.""

So here they are, making ends meet. A small family with a bastard son. And, this kid is *weird*. All he does he go off on these stupid little adventures, swearing he can talk to birds or something. Thankfully, his (Step?) Dad taught him the trade. Jesus can cut a chair like it ain't nobody's business. Well, it really *isn't* anyone's business, because none of the chairs sell. Apparently a miniature figurine isn't the hot ticket in Nazareth, but Jesus, he's still learning. If only he'd get his head out of the clouds. 

Like one day he's in town with Mary and starts talking to the old guys by the temple. They're having real, heavy, deep mind spiritual talk, and the old men, they're impressed. Mary however, was *hard* pressed. ""Didn't I tell you not to go off away from me?"" She snapped at the boy.

""I'm about my Father's business.""

""You're not selling any chairs here Jesus.""

""No. I'm doing God's work.""

""We're going home.""

So they went home, and Jesus grew up. Eventually he was old enough, and now skilled enough, to do more than make wooden chair figurines. He wanted *out*. Nazareth was so, small, and like, the world, was so big. It felt like that anyway.

And straightway he departed.

Now this is where the story gets relatable. Homeboy is out there in the desert, way beyond fig trees and ponds. Like, bruh. I need some moisture, in my esophagus. Dry cracked kissers gatekeeping a quarter pound of flesh glued to the roof of his mouth. And hunger wasn't even an option. The body was *crawling* in desperation of sustenance. Then it happened. He snapped. 

Poof. Satan appeared. Offered Jesus, the *world*. All of this is yours if you only obey me. Me. Which *me* is that? Well, let's back up a bit. 

*If you're not playing the rewind sound of a tape recorder in your imagination right now, you should.*

Before Jesus straightway departed, he saw his lunatic cousin John. See, John was already accustom to being a vagabond. He was a nasty, all natural, quasi-vegan (only ate bugs and fruit), who kept insisting people needed to swim with him in the river to avoid eternal damnation. And people listened. Because there was a line, always. ""#DunkMe.""

Anyway, Jesus gets dunked and afterward he looks up and sees the spirit of God descending down. He hears a voice, ""You are my son in whom I am well pleased."" So you can see how he was already prone to hallucinating (?) before stumbling around in the desert with Sinister Susan. It runs in the family. 

So he goes through the wilderness being tempted and survives, holding faith to what he heard about being the son of God. He held onto the faith of it, not the power of it. You understand? Love. Not the effect. Love. Not the effect.

Ok, we're gonna speed through some of this. Hand and arms inside please. Watch your head. 

Jesus roams around from town to town hanging out with other artists and counter culture love bugs of the day. He knew a thing or two about partying, celebrating life and seeing people eye-to-eye. And also miracles. Simply being around him was a miracle, because be was *so present*. Just, alive.

The conservative cabal. I mean uh. The priests and political powers that be in the town didn't like it. He was causing too much of a fuss, disturbing the status quo. Giving the people something to believe in *other than* Laws and Trickle Down Economics. And magic. This guy had *pizazz*, you understand?

So Sinister Susan helped them divine a plan to corrupt the agenda of Love *not knowing their plan was Love made manifest*. Hubris is kinda funny that way. As is Judas. The central character of the story. All he did, was betray, which was the seed of corruption itself.

Can loyalty be bought? Yes. Can love be bought?

No.

And herein lies the demonstration of Jesus dying, coiled in dismembered anguish on the splintered cross. He still *loved* those who betrayed him, *all the way through the last breath*. You understand?

Be loved,

Let us love one another. Like this.

If you want.",OrganicAnybody1747,1642055074

226,awakened,Naked Amongst the Flames of Hell,"Even before I loaded my bicycle on the plane headed towards the Montana/Canadian border, I was anxiously yearning for the challenges on my journey ahead. In the 3,000 miles I was going to bike south through the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains and into Mexico, I anticipated arduous moments which would test the strength of the armor I had built up from previous experiences. Although I was also drawn by the beauty of the natural environment, I envisioned the trip as an extended descent into the fires of a forge, hesitantly longing for the experiences where I would be tempered and strengthened by the heat and pressure. My bicycle was a chariot to convey me deep into the depths of hell.

I had been on the road for over two months, facing Grizzly and black bears, blinding blizzards, and bike failures before I found myself in the drug cartel controlled state of Sinaloa, Mexico. There was one day of riding through the jungly state where the metaphorical flames were especially hot. I was biking through unknown territory along a highway strutted upon by giant semi trucks robbing me of my physical safety. The heat of the sun‚Äôs love affair with the humidity of the tropical forests caught me in the crossfire of the intensity, materialized as a constant stream of sweat and damp clothing. Maintaining hydration was a constant concern mitigated by stops for electrolytic water at the rare stores alongside the road. The language barrier added to the isolation I felt from the few people I came across along the day‚Äôs miles.

As the day faded to an early autumn evening, I was forced to contend with failing to reach the safety of my intended motel in a town still far ahead. Instead, I would need to stealth camp someplace along my chaotic highway. I dragged my bike through the thick overgrowth alongside the highway, past the garbage that clung to the roadside like cholesterol to an artery. I aimed for a patch of trees planted intentionally in a sort of grid. Dragging my bike through the growth and soft earth covered in a thin film of mostly-dried mud from past flooding was difficult work, especially after the long day of riding and the salted fountain flowing from my forehead. I carried a large branching stick projecting forward from my handlebars like a mermaid on the bow of a ship to clear the many spiderwebs catching not only the encircling flies and mosquitoes, but also feelings of further disgust from my wearied spirit.

A few hundred feet of this awkward dragging had me settle on a suitable site. I rested my bike against a tree and began to pitch my tent. Some time into this process, I was startled by some animal noises. Darting my eyes in the direction of the sound, I saw two small wild pigs patrolling the area just a stone‚Äôs throw away. Although they paid me no mind, their presence created a further sense of eeriness and unfamiliarity, challenging my dwindling protection around my sense of safety and security.

The last of the light was withering as I finished the final touches on my camp. The encircling mosquitoes were now veiled in darkness, safe from my former acute vision. I finished my nightly hygienic routine, brushed away as much of the plant matter and sand clinging to my moist body, and clambered into my tent. With the help of my headlight, I expelled all the visible mosquitoes that followed me in. Yet the cost of this luxury was the fear of being seen by some patrolling farmer, landowner, or cartel member sicario.

Since my mind was no longer entertained by the chores of the day and the detail of the landscapes, it turned to the cruel creation of imagined scenarios. Perhaps this land truly was owned by the cartels and I stumbled upon a site which would soon be used for some illicit activity. My mind enthusiastically sketched up a vivid reality where an angry man driving an ATV sped up to my site with a shotgun slung over his shoulders. I heard the sensible part of me asking ‚Äúwhat the hell am I doing here?‚Äù I imagined the despair of my wife learning about my lonely death. Or worse, her awaiting any shards of news after my sudden disappearance. As I lay there, completely uncovered except for my underwear, the sweat pooled in the divot within my sleeping mat created by my spent body. Each movement was met by the abrasion of the remaining sand still clinging to my body despite the former effort.

I was deep within the fires of the forge and I felt entirely trapped, writhing around in severe discomfort. The flames of the forge had been scalding for hours and the temperature was only continuing to rise as sleep escaped my wearied embrace. I projected the unknowns into the future. What if every night is exactly like this for the next week? I created hypothetical scenarios of intense pain, fear, loneliness, and discomfort. The flames had my blood simmering. My mind reached for any semblance of escape from the suffering present in the moment. It cast me into the future in hope of manufacturing the peace and safety I needed so badly. With my armor so weakened by the flames, I scrambled to construct more layers to protect me.

Like a tea kettle at last whistling the tune of a full boil, the inferno of suffering finally broke me. I was no longer strong enough to bear the weight of my armor resisting the flames and it fell from my charred body. I braced for the encroaching flames I expected to burn my now defenseless self alive. I surrendered to the full pain of the present moment, the discomfort, the pain, the fear of death. Yet what I found as my armor clattered upon the ground was utter peace. Standing naked amongst the fire, although I still knew the heat of the flames, I stood up within the forge unburned. The tongues of fire still danced in full force around my body, yet where there was formerly suffering, I found only a profound and pure peace. Abject stillness as the backdrop of the chaos. Who I found myself to be underneath the armor‚Äìwho we all are‚Äìis untouchable. I was even unthreatened by the shotgun slugs which could so easily rip through my body. The suffering was vanquished, leaving only the trailing wisps of smoke.

In the blissful stillness of the still-roaring forge, it became apparent that the suffering‚Äìthe burning‚Äìwas an experience I created. It did not come directly from the forge, but was created entirely by my resistance to the heat. I wasn‚Äôt burned by the flames, but by my scalding white-hot armor‚Äìthe very thing I believed would protect me. I floated heavenly in this moment, feeling love bubbling from deep within me, no longer constrained by the armor and lust for comfort. I reveled in the deep feelings of well-being that visited me, carrying bountiful gifts of revelation. I realized that love and peace are not feelings or temporary states, but are instead the very essence of who we are. We remember this when we allow everything that keeps us from the present moment to be. We remember who we are when we surrender to everything we are not.

Although it is tempting to curse the armor‚Äìour resistance to pain‚Äìfor its lies of false peace and security, it reveals itself to be an exceptionally useful tool in its own right. When we traverse through smaller, less immersive forges in life, it collects the contact with the raw truth of reality as charred blemishes, melted patches, scratches, dings, and dents. It is a buffer which absorbs hardship momentarily, allowing us to traverse daily life without frequent inopportune breakdowns. Yet we must actively set it down after these small scraps lest it becomes the very hell it‚Äôs designed to help us traverse. We must expose our naked selves to trace our fingers across the scars, embodying the energy stored within the ore. During the more chronic forges raging throughout our lives, the most effective act can be to shed the armor and turn fully towards the transgression. Who we are underneath remains unburned by the flames. All that remains is‚Ä¶eternally us.",asgaines25,1642022740

Close the eyes and look up with the eyes very slightly from the median line between the upper and lower halves of the vision of the eyes. Next look at a single point with the eyes and keep the eyes as still as possible on that one point. This meditation works after you do it and serve others in whatever way you decide to actually serve others, whether it be doing the dishes or volunteering somewhere.

So much so It‚Äôs like second nature.,If I find a lady who I like I will go all in with that lady. My life will and has revolved around the relationship that I enter. It has been a curse and gift to be in one that hurt me. So that I could see more clearly the vulnerable nature I was portraying and the misunderstanding with my experience. Since what I was asking was someone to join into the future with me. Someone to toss the present aside in chase if a bright pre planned future. We both knew it was fading and they always do the passion dies and what‚Äôs left? What does cause someone to love someone? Is it merely a fleeting thing always? Could you love someone homeless living in a tent on the streets of the city? Could you love someone who lost their way for long periods of time? It seems this love we find is an attempt at love but it is a scared love. We are scared we won‚Äôt find it again. So we clutch on tight to the love we do find in the fear we will never see anything like that come to fruition in the future if we don‚Äôt. This can be very validating but quickly becomes possessive and controlling. It drives a stake of secret resentment into the experience. Becuase at first it starts out with no expectation but soon it becomes nothing but expectation. Such a heavy experience. Let us lift each other up.

235,awakened,The Ultimate Proof of Free Will,"Choices themselves are a limitation. Meditation is proof of free will. If we are merely the byproduct of our environment, there would be no reason to do it. It is the anti-choice. The moment we choose anything external, we have limited ourselves to that choice, however momentary it may be. Choices trade our limitlessness with a limitation. When you are truly liberated, you are free from choices because you are continuously experiencing the transcendence of choice. This is the reason that the illusion of free will exists; it gives you the chance to eventually choose the best, often after your other choices are exhausted.

Even if your choices led you to emptiness and despair, nothing can take away from you the choice to experience your limitlessness. The last place most people will ever focus is within. Consequently, doing so is an act of defiance against the conformity of determinism. For this reason, self-determinism is the antithesis of determinism. Focus on Self is the Ultimate proof of free will.

The choice to quit smoking is a great example of free will. Why do people do this? They are choosing limitlessness over the physical addiction that gives them the illusion of satisfaction. This discomfort to go against the protestations of your body that screams for this fix of pleasure is widely regarded as common sense now. Why is it logical to quit? It's because science proves that nonsmokers are healthier and live longer. In other words, smoking limits you. In the same way, only an inward focus, free from external desires, is the least limiting choice. This choice of non-choice is the ultimate expression of free will.",realAtmaBodha,1642013489

In order to experience life as a finite form, God must limit himself, and¬†also forget that he is God, this is the only way he will be able to get absorbed by the life drama. In the same way that you must forget that you are sleeping in your bed, to get identified as the dreamer.¬†

Imagine watching a movie, and every minute a warning appear: ‚ÄúTHIS IS ALL ACTING, NOTHING HAPPENING IS REAL‚Äù.¬† I‚Äôm sure everybody will leave, because the whole point in watching a movie, playing video games and indeed dreaming, is to forgot that they are¬†‚ÄúJust an acting‚Äù and to live it as if it‚Äôs¬†‚Äúreal‚Äù.

This ‚ÄúWaking State‚Äù is all happening inside our head, there‚Äôs no external objects. There is no distance between us, and whatever appears in our consciousness. it‚Äôs exactly the same as we dream, everything happens inside our mind, is just imagination created by the mind, within the mind.¬†

Although we think that the objects that appears inside our dream is far away from us, but it‚Äôs actually one with the consciousness, everything is equally close at the same distance. like the landscape you see in a movie, it‚Äôs one with the screen, not far away in the background.¬†

You can take the VR headset as another example, everything that appears in the virtual reality world is not a couple of meters away from you, there‚Äôs no difference between it and the way we experience the world. think about it!

When I kiss her I can feel her soul like I‚Äôm directly connected to it. My penis is as hard as a rock and it feels like a waterfall is pouring out of her vagina, it feels like a lake on the bed from all her juices. She had an orgasm and then I feel her inner child get tired so I tuck her into bed. I continue to talk to her and realize that when she‚Äôs asleep that her soul can actually hear me and I should talk to her in her sleep so she can truly hear me.

2:00-3:00 (Time unknown)
Decide to look in mirror expecting to see a thousand faces like what Ashleigh‚Äôs looked like but instead I only see my face but my face is the face of God. It‚Äôs as if my ‚Äúreflection‚Äù isn‚Äôt a reflection, like I‚Äôm not looking at myself but someone else.

255,awakened,"Your ego is core to your personality, a necessary vehicle for the Truth of your spirit to incarnate","Transcending ego does not mean getting rid of it, but rather to have it in appropriate perspective. One must admit they know nothing before they can first grasp something, as the material world is only the surface-level that becomes illusory when we lack our proper senses.

There are three things that destroy our senses; pollution, violence, and deception. Pollution will inhibit your body from its full bioelectrical capacity, preventing neural communication from fully witnessing the life present. Violence breaks parts of our body, creating scar tissue that lacks neural and vascular innervation. Deception breaks parts of our memory, creating discomfort in cognitive dissonance when the labels we know clash with reality. 

Spiritual and mental illness is when one identifies as the breaks, which inhibit our ability to be in higher consciousness.

All three of these run deep into the history that spirit remembers. All times exist in conjunction, the difference is how separated you are from this moment in relation to all moments; each one is just as important in the grand scheme and there are so many moving parts of consciousness that are constantly recycling life through the collective of all. Each one of us is constantly making the choice as to what we serve, and the lower aspects of this world are incredibly heavy in the gravity that pulls us away from our higher capacity. 

Your ego is how you relate with your emotions which are always present whether you pay attention to them or not. Children begin this world as enlightened beings (although some unfortunate souls are unfairly polluted in the womb to make the process even more difficult), but the trauma being perpetuated in this world will constantly reshape our brain away from what is real. We are trained to be obedient and servile, but exactly what it is that we are serving is where we must seek inwards to rediscover our soul. 

The human brain works by labelling and categorizing everything in its perception; I look down and see a keyboard whereas a dog will see a contraption that smells weird and a cat will see the colors. If you are only paying attention to the surface of the labels, then you will never see what is moving behind the scenes, especially in the labels of how one refers to themselves in their thought and speech. 

We do not realize the immense space that is between our emotions and our thoughts because it happens so fast. Can you feel the space in your brain? With practice you can move between these rooms in our head and unpack what is within. And oh boy, there is a *lot* to unpack. 

The brain is a sponge that is programmed by these electrical signals created by oxidizing blood. However, the heavy metal pollution of this world from lead, arsenic, cyanide, and other toxic materials pump through our brain with gravity pulling them down to our innermost brain organs. The shrapnel passing through the soft flesh gets caught, creating a shell of insulating materials that hinder our ability to actually connect to our innermost emotions. Lead literally blocks bioelectricity from being able to reach the core state; transmuting lead into light is effecting shadow work, which is using our willpower to examine the blockages and reroute our thoughts around the impediment so that blood can flush it out. 

We always see from our third eye, but most people do not even realize it. Close one eye, you see from the open one. Switch eyes, you see from the other. But the mental map creating the whole of vision that you partake is a result of the third eye; opening it is learning how to move it as easily as the others. With this ability, our space as a multidimensional being truly takes hold as you can move your consciousness up and down your spine, truly opening your perception to another axis of movement from before. 

Have you ever been so focused that you didn't hear somebody calling your name? The sleeping state is when our subconscious focus is too busy trying to uphold an image in our mind resulting from the past thoughts we have embodied in our neural pathways, unable to take control of its third eye because of the weight carried deep within. There is only a small part of you that is looking at the world through two magnifying glasses, and the light travelling on the neural wiring to reach that point gets pulled down and distorted by the lead and other heavy poisons. It completely warps our vision into forgetting anything beyond itself. 

When men sent their slaves into gold mines for their superiority complex, the poisoning began to take hold. Now every gunshot fired propagates the continuous warfare that has never ended in our known history as humans continue destroying the planet for an artificial version of gold that holds the same spell. The lead in gunpowder, the violence of a bullet, the deception necessary to convince men to die for the gains of a few all carry the infection down the family line. Each gold coin ever minted had a human who needed to carry it out of the ground (goldpanning still counts), and two of the minerals gold is most commonly contained within are galena and arsenopyrite; lead and arsenic respectively. 

We are born enlightened, curious, empathic, and desperately loving. We lose it as the poisons begin to set hold and spells hold our thoughts in specific prisons. The work of rediscovering the nuances of our inner soul is figuring out how many pollutants in our mind and body are preventing our spirit from being properly witnessed. 

But in war, the first casualty is the truth. The most wounded is our humanity, which gets completely lost when we forget how to see a human for a human and relabel it as an enemy.

Stare long enough into the abyss, and it stares back at you. You cannot understand your own humanity if you can't see it in every other one of us. The lowered mindset starts at the top with the ones who owned the gold mines, giving only a pittance to those digging it out while their minds descended into violence against each other to keep scraping by. The only thing that has changed over time is that we got more efficient at all parts, especially the lying.

That All-encompassing Consciousness is also what the human being has unanimously called God, whose presence one can discover in one's own deep interiority, in undivided union with one's own being.

269,awakened,My First Mushroom Trip,"To give a little backstory, I first got into spirituality about 3.5 years ago when I was 19 about to turn 20. I had a spontaneous kundalini awakening which I had unknowingly triggered by releasing years of childhood trauma, anger, and frustration in the span of 5 hours during a phone call with my dad. After I hung up, my reality had completely shifted from that point forward. I experienced near-constant synchronicity which scared me at first because I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening, and I became manic for several days, receiving full clarity over everything that has ever happened to me, as well as a constant flood of information about how we‚Äôre all connected and how everything has gone exactly the way it should. Because I was in this manic state, I was also high for several days straight, and my personality had completely changed as I had fully embodied my higher self, which startled my parents and friends. My parents ended up taking me to the hospital and I was moved to a mental hospital for a week where they were of course unable to give me a firm diagnosis since this was the first time something like this had ever happened to me. They stated I might be hypomanic (mild form of bipolar 2), but of course that diagnosis didn‚Äôt even come close to accounting for everything I had experienced during my awakening.

I‚Äôve experienced synchronicity on a daily basis ever since, and had numerous spiritual/manic experiences with and without the aid of cannabis, as well as an LSD trip nearly a year ago which reaffirmed to me the idea that everything is already predetermined, and that everything is going to be alright no matter what. 

Ever since that LSD trip, I had really wanted to try mushrooms, and finally had my first trip a few days ago. It was one of the most beautiful experiences I‚Äôve ever had, and I learned so much from it. For one, we‚Äôre all God, and God experiences itself through us. This was an idea that I already believed going into the trip, but it was truly something else to fully experience that idea for myself. During my LSD trip, I was on the verge of leaving my ego and embodying God, but ultimately was too afraid/uncomfortable at the time. This time I allowed myself to fully let go, and finally got to fully understand that I am God, and so is everyone else and everything else. At the peak of the experience, I‚Äôve never felt so loved. It was as if waves of unconditional love constantly cascaded over me. I cried for probably at least 20 minutes as I began to accept all of these realizations. I‚Äôve never felt so God and yet so human at the same time. I‚Äôve never felt so vulnerable and yet so safe. I also realized just how much I love being human, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm currently having this human experience. I realized that (as God) I‚Äôve created everything and everyone I‚Äôve ever interacted with, family, friends, pets, romantic interests, etc. And above all, I finally understood why we suffer and why we have egos. It not only allows us to be more human, but without the pain, without the suffering, there wouldn‚Äôt be any joy or bliss. Light can‚Äôt exist without darkness. And I guess we‚Äôre kind of masochistic in that way haha. Lastly, I learned that I deserve everything good that ever comes to me and that I deserve unconditional love, as does everyone else. And similarly to when I was on LSD, I remembered that everything is going to be alright and that none of this life really matters that much, so don‚Äôt take it so seriously. This was my best attempt to put this experience into words, but at its peak, it was truly ineffable. You should definitely give mushrooms a try if you haven‚Äôt already.",j_cole22,1641928738

What is real? If you take drugs to get high, you found a crutch, not the Crux.

Science tells us that everything you experience is a result of neurons and synapses in your brain firing off to one other. In other words, your life experience is entirely composed of electric signals. If you can master these signals, you can recreate reality itself into the image of what you want it to be. At bare minimum, you should be able to create for yourself any kind of high without needing to take the actual drug. This is the ultimate kind of hacking; hacking into your own consciousness. Once you go down this path, you realize life is not merely mechanical. Consciousness exceeds the limits that science attempts to place upon it.

Many people don't realize that the mind has the capacity to visualize things in incredible detail, and even it's possible to rotate intricately detailed objects in your head in 3d. This is why many people claim that books are often better than the movie. Your imagination can exceed the visuals produced by even the most expensive Hollywood blockbuster.

And yet, when you silence the mind for an extended period of time, something else happens that is beyond your imagination. A brilliant flash of inspiration occurs, or perhaps the velvety blanket of tranquility envelopes you. Ultimately, the Crown is besieged by a torrent of Bliss.

281,awakened,"The feeling of becoming awareness, and simple meditation on how to bring through the light and instantly raise your vibration","I want to start off by explaining my understanding on how awareness is connected to light.  Reading this you may or may not already understand how awareness and light are one in the same, but learning about true internal awareness leads to infinite consciousness or wisdom.  Externally, or physically (in 3D awareness),  it can easily be explained. We can only see things because it is a source of light, or its an object that reflects light from a light source back to you. It works the same internally, and how we react to external reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

External reality is a constant reflection of internal reality, and everything you react to externally is really something youre reacting to internally, usually an emotion, but always a feeling. Instead of letting your ego react, or water boil, accept the feelings you feel and know that you can feel multiple emotions towards something at the same time, but nobody is really controlling how you feel, and if you let the water settle and look for the reflection you‚Äôll always see it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Externally reality works like light because its constantly shining a light on your own mind because you‚Äôre creating it with your mind. Everything you experience is a manifestation of your own thought, and the real tricky manifestations are belief systems that have manifested and work like unconscious and subconscious mind programs that make up your solidified energy field. From the age 0-7 our minds are like sponges and we see our parents as gods or accept everything they say as the truth, and this is the stage that makes up our belief systems, and we feel our belief systems as our emotions and reactions. So every time you react to something it‚Äôs a reflection of your own behavior, or else there would be no energetic resistance to feed into.

&amp;#x200B;

 You can become awareness in meditation when you focus simply on what you‚Äôre aware of. Then when you start to see the reflections you‚Äôll start to change your behavior because you realize its an unloving unconscious behavior you don‚Äôt really want. Then when you get rid of enough shit and  open your third eye you can think of internal awareness from a  third dimensional standpoint, then your light body starts to wake up and you connect to awareness externally kind of like the zedd ‚Äúclarity‚Äù album cover. Then you see yourself in everything infinitly, and if you cant see yourself in something you just look harder until you see the reflection, its infinite introspection that leads to infinoite wisdom.

And I wonder, what experiences made these ideas come to life? What life experiences make you awakened?

And can they be scientifically proven to be true or is it something beyond science?

If they are beyond science, how can I be sure that these ideas are true?

286,awakened,I remember...,"Writing this after being moved to tears listening to Bach.

Picture this:

An 8 year old boy who's been emotionally abused and disrupted in lifestyle over and over. He's alone, afraid, angry, but mostly sad.

Clown at heart. Secretly wishing most days to share pure Laughter with friends. Like Jimmy, the peer who enjoyed playing chess with the afraid 8 year old.

Jimmy died, actually. His health had already been in serious decline from some incurable disease which left him chairbound and intubated. But he was always present, and always ready to play Chess. So they played.

When Jimmy died, the 8 year old told no one. Because no one knew of their friendship. No one knew the silence they shared. No one knew the joy met in one another's eyes. It was only between the pair. 

Grandmom died too that year. Suddenly, although likewise in decline. Grandmom's thigh cushioned the boy's head from his infancy until he was forced to move with a stepfather. And now, gone. 

So the young boy tried gymnastics, cello, acting, singing, anything to soothe the pain of heartache. Not at the loss of those he loved, but at the confusion of those they left behind.

How fragile a thing, life. Remarkable. Beautiful. Destructive. And fragile.

So the split happened. The boy buried his clown and Divine Laughter to Grow Up And Be An Adult. Except, adulthood was only an idea. It was a poorly conceived and ill-executed attempt and mimicking the bigger kids around him. 

Because surely they knew better. They said they knew, so they must, right? Wrong. Doubt snuck in. Mistrust. Anger raged, flaming violently beneath the sands of posterity. Each grain meticulously coated in bitter anguish,

And sin.

So the War began. Division ravaged through the land of the boy's mind and he became obsessively fractured, scattered across heartbreak and yearning. For freedom.

Total. Unconditional Freedom.

And by Grace, here we are,

All. Together.

Each fragment worth living, and loving, in Total acceptance.

May each artist Return home

To the Heart. And love unconditional, come what may. Be you. Create. Allow life to breathe *through* you.

At the collective level, all these desires and actions of billions of people are ""summed up"" and, as a result, different options for a common future are formed.

 It is in the information field of the Earth that this ""summation"" takes place.  It looks like a super-complex system that comprehends this data and, as a result, ""gives out"" future versions of events.

 First of all, we ourselves send the data to the information field of the Earth, and it processes them.

All of creation exists by its Grace.

The balance between retaining your individuality while also merging with the Infinite is the only ""balance"" to be concerned with.

The difference between a wise man and a foolish man, is that the foolish man is like a shallow stream and loudly proclaims all of the rocks and pebbles on the bottom as proof of his wisdom. The wise man is like a deep ocean, he cannot see the bottom so he is silent.

We are given the illusion of free will, but actually there's nothing that we can choose that can prevent the inevitable outcome of our eventual enlightenment. You will succeed in spite of yourself, the only question is if you want to sooner rather than later. Do you want to be a spectator or the star of your own life?

If you inspire people to be heroes, does that mean that you are taking away their free will?

Isn't that the greatest superpower? When we inspire others, we affect their free will and alter the course of their lives, for the better.

Inspiring others is not the same as manipulating them. When we feel enraptured by a scene of wondrous beauty like in nature, we don't feel manipulated by Nature, but enchanted by it.

Importantly, the intent is not to manipulate others to a specific end other than their own potential.

Once we acknowledge that we are at un-exceedable limits, then we stagnate.

There is a deeper purpose that beats within the heart of all of us. And that commonality is what unites us and drives us toward a shared culmination.

Expansion is a constant.
Even God is in the continuous state of expansion. If you are not expanding, then you are not going with the flow.

An Illumined mind is stronger than a thousand or perhaps 10,000 or perhaps a million or more minds. The few have always been responsible for the most major shifts in history.

‚ÄúThings You Need to Know About
BDSM
Talk to your partner first
Having the conversation prlor to your first encounter
is much better than just showing up in leather with a
riding crop in your hand.
With power comes responsibility
BDSM relationships must be buill on trust, and knowing that
you're dominant will be there to take care of you in the end,
both physically and emotionally.
Consent &amp; Communication
Having forceful sex with someone is not BDSM.
Both the partners' consent is required in BDSM.
BDSM doesn't have to hurt
BDSM isn't always about whips and chains and
handcuffs. There are no rules. It can also be painless
and just sensual.
Safety is of highest priority
BDSM world involves a lot a spanking. hitting, tying.
hanging, etc. So it's a good idea to take
precautions along the way. What happens in the
bedroom stays in the bedroom.‚Äù

Foreword...

I don‚Äôt care who are...

I will treat you like I do myself üôÇ 

Sometimes that might mean, treating you like **** üôÇ

You can‚Äôt hurt me if you try to bully me because that means you still care. :) 

You can only hurt me if you forget about my existence üòû

-

Credit for everything goes to everyone who treat me like shit or pretended I don‚Äôt exist :) 

-

We are strong if, we can accept and tell the truth, be honest with ourselves and other people. :) 

We are strong if, we can show kindness to those who don‚Äôt deserve respect :) 

We are strong if, we can forgive ourselves and everyone‚Äôs actions :) 

We are weak if, we lie, bully or don‚Äôt take responsibility for what we allow :)

-

Now... 

The secret to philosophy is, it is true if you believe it to be true. Philosophy is like taking the tomato and making tomato sauce, putting it in a blender. Knowledge is knowing it is a tomato. By these means, philosophy keeps getting closer to the tomato. We make pur√©e then we make slices and eventually we find our tomato, wisdom, is putting knowledge in the right order... All philosophy is bull**** around what could be true. Wisdom is the result of good philosophy, which stands the time until another cycle begins. Philosophy is the love of wisdom.

Wisdom is the ‚Äútruth‚Äù known consciously. Wisdom is basically what is with the times; what the crowd can agree upon, what has consistent value. As for philosophy, we wouldn‚Äôt pick an incoherent philosophy out of the air but, someone may have an experience that gives them a philosophy that is ahead of the times. It only works if we truly believe it. :) 

So basically psychosis = differently sane. :)

Their‚Äôs layers to the truth but everything is built on truth. Truth can have more than one answer but a limited amount of answers. Meaning it is possible to understand the universe. :) 

We are unlimited awareness but what we are materialistically is limited so, in other words. Wisdom is limited. Philosophy is unlimited. 

ID = Our wisdom 

Ego = Philosophy  

-

So, we are our actions.

What we have done in our past is what creates the Angels &amp; Demons that surround us.

Angels &amp; Demons are also manifest by the things done to us.

So for example we sacrifice people to summon a Demon.

This creates our karma, Karma is when we don‚Äôt learn our lesson the same situation repeats until we accept our mistakes &amp; make the changes.

-

Angels &amp; Demons are what create our personality
We can think of the ego as presence and that be all our demons playing together. 

Until we make our Demons conscious we will continue to be controlled by them from our subconscious. Preventing us from being ourselves. What we have not made conscious of is our shadow. 

-

Life is about growth, holding on and letting go. We gain wisdom from Angels and Demons. 

To create a Demon we go to experience something and start a ritual*, then we simply let our Demons out to play and let them possess someone else. Talk about them, write poetry, a short story or a lesson we learned. This way they lose their power. The karma is released. 
* A ritual is taking a long way home around the action to create a better result, we apply the method to the madness and take small steps into creating bigger actions. Like gathering ingredients to find the answers to what we want to achieve, emptying our minds to gain the power and manifest something we want :)

This is us creating the capacity to fulfil our dreams. We take the steps towards our dreams. This is creating more space inside ourselves for them to happen. Whilst we are doing this; we are attracting the reality we want, by implementing our intention we create a ripple that spirals back to us. This is how our thoughts create our reality. We‚Äôre forcing the universe to conspire in our favour until we master what we are doing and gain wisdom from the ritual. ‚ÄúI am‚Äù is the beginning of all wisdom, what we say after these words are what creates our reality.

Where ever there‚Äôs a will there‚Äôs a way; if we are dedicated enough, we can do anything :) 

We change our minds, we change the world around us, we can be sheep or we can think for ourselves, we can be moulded all our lives or we can take back our power and become a creator. 

We react to every action and we become the creation and creator. The idea is to shape reality to our will. We have chaos coming from the outside, this causes frustration, chaos inside us. This is where our power lies. We choose whether to be big or small. If we react to that chaos with chaos, we are creating more chaos. If we have chaos coming towards us and we take a step back to ground ourselves* that chaos slowly becomes harmony and loses power. We have to take a step back and create order out of the chaos and line everything up with who we are. If we just absorb chaos and never take the time to be alone, chaos is all we will know. Being calm is a good goal to aim for. So the idea is, to become a stone, make everything solid. Until nothing frustrates us and we have no chaos inside or outside us. Thus, we have no friction, in reality, manifesting everything we want at will. Essentially achieving perfection and immortality

For example, if we are being bullied, the bully‚Äôs attacks antagonise us and take our attention. If we get frustrated and attack back, we give our power away, we create more chaos, they steal our attention. if we create a calm space in ourselves, become one with it, choose non-action and concentrate on reality. The bully eventually gets tired of the same attacks, hurting themselves along the way and naturally becomes calmer. Thus, we have created the reality of the reality we desired. 

*Grounding ourselves is being aware of everything we are &amp; everything we are not, what the world is around us and what the world is inside us, having a firm knowledge of ourselves

-

We are Karma, Demons are our imperfections we fear being seen by the crowd, the fears that control us, this is how we attract what we fear, we become what we hate.

 Demons will stay with us until we learn our lesson and then create change. Demons are out to get us, Angels are there to save us. Demons give us the challenges in life, Angels give us the wisdom to get through them. Demons are like our children, frenemies, we have to give them something to look up to. We can think of Angels as our higher self, the elders. 

So, we are the sins of our fathers. In this sense, we are an accumulation of our ancestors. Each generation naturally practices self-control and has had a sense of Good and Evil. Meaning, we inherit fewer &amp; fewer Demons and we‚Äôre acquiring more &amp; more wisdom through generations over time until we enter heaven.

In other words, we have to go through hell and defeat all our Demons to get to heaven.

-

Is there an alternate universe running backwards? One where philosophy comes first we are drawing all our energy from, the void must be a wormhole our imagination is trapped in eager to be discovered.

Wisdom = time
 
Philosophy = space üôÇ

-

Dimensions:

3rd dimension = action, material world

4th dimension = thought, the dream world

5th dimension = no thought, spirit world

The universe is a mirror so there would be ten dimensions because we are in the middle of the middle looking in at the middle

They say life is better understood backwards so, the universe manifest from point A to B. From everywhere to one point. 

The highest dimension we can see being the tenth so, we go down the middle and we would say the 5th dimension is the centre of the universe. This is where the universe started but, this is not true. This creates dimension zero which is the egg, so, we have the 5th dimension down the middle of the spectrum which is the sperm. The 1st and the tenth, all this creates you, a little spec, a special creation, a little miracle, a 5D, 3D hologram but, we‚Äôre not alone. We were shattered at the start. We mirror again. This is the 1st Dimension meaning the universe started with a twin flame. Each spec is going across distance in a straight line, each made of 3 points so, each spec is made up of zero, the fifth and the 3rd. Space, time &amp; matter, creating a 3,6,9 pattern in every direction. This is the 3,6,9 method. This creates the other key to the universe, 1,3,7. One is made of three, three is made of nine &amp; seven is made of twenty one creating a brand new pattern, 3,9,21, within twenty-one, we have 3,6,9 in every direction, plus zero this means we are twenty-two-dimensional beings. This means everything Devine that could be manifest, manifest at the start of the universe with unlimited possibility :)

This would mean each universe is contracting or expanding. That there are only beginnings. All life is a game, the universe is like a Russian doll. 

This would mean we are all born at the centre of the universe. We are born with all the wisdom of the universe and life is a journey moving closer or further away from the centre of the universe as we develop, discovering wisdom or not. We are the singularity. This makes us creation &amp; creator. :)

We all have the Ontic Sphere,

‚Äú Deep inside the being of human life there's a secret connection to powers and forces, the refined and raw energies of the world and the cosmos beyond it, all funnelling down and inward to that secret connection and flowing through the entire ontic sphere\* of the human being, bringing more reality to the reality than it had before it was fed the true foods of existence, the blending of experiences and the feelings, and from the ontic sphere spreading out to all the world,  radiating like a microscopic star the rays and beams of a  formative influence, making the human being more than a consumer or a  parasite,  but a symbiote, a producer even of the transformation flows through the topologies shaping reality everywhere. This is a good purpose for human beings, enriching the very planet and its planes themselves, and between them, even more, special the magick, the sorcery,  the craft,  the very tales of love and drama, the majestic other dimensions of the being of the human family.  
Consciousness is more than a trip, it's a vital part of our present cosmos &amp; chaos alike.  
\*An  Ontic sphere, to the best of my understanding, is the world which  you  live interplaying with your psyche and its organic expressions,   creating an almost ultra fractal and transracial appearance and   relevance to life.‚Äù - written by Jerry David Rosenberger

So in theory. Each solar system is like a little universe. There are possibly little you are running around with one leg missing. Our imagination is a portal. All the chaos happening here right now is all the chaos happening everywhere in the universe.  We could be the first to leave the planet and it‚Äôs probably already happened. Our realist us would be immortal and complete all challenges in life. All life across the universe shares the 3D 5D realm.

-

So, everything that exists inside the mind has already happened somewhere or is about to happen. Everything is a phase. Everything is a figment of our imagination. Life is but a dream.

We could say we all share the same dream and it‚Äôs a dream within a dream. Meaning we all share the same wisdom with unlimited paths of getting there.

Laying down creates the universal consciousness, where we are ‚Äúdead‚Äù and dream. 

Standing creates bicameral  consciousness, where we become alive and use our will

The living dead would have no goals &amp; the truly alive stand for something :)

It could be that we are only alive because we are waking up in someone else‚Äôs dream. With machines taking over we will naturally have less and less to do and probably have the possibility of entering an isolation tank to just lucid dream. With this being the likely future and is going to happen. Could the Universe be a projection of One Mind connected to the internet? 

Could this mean the matrix is a documentary? :)

Either way... 

-

It does mean we are all connected. Meaning we all have attachments, Demons. This causes frustration &amp; frustration is the door to perception. We all desire happiness &amp; the more wisdom &amp; philosophy we attain the more heavenly life is. We can take these steps, (Compassion &gt; self-control&gt; reason) on the way to attaining wisdom. 

We have the question do we have free will? On one side we say everything happens for a reason, it is determined. On the other side, we say everything is random, nothing matters. If we go down the middle we say, self-control is a form of free will. Yes, some things are determined and the more awareness we have the more choice we have. The middle path is useful for philosophy. The middle path may mean going a hard right to balance a weak left. 

So, in the event where we can predict the events leading up to the future. 

Is the event we can take control of and bend reality to our will... 

We have a range of freedom according to the capacity of what we have experienced and the idea‚Äôs we have developed :) 

Meaning to act is the key to freedom üôÇ 

So, the universe runs on probability üôÇ 

We are not the author of our thoughts. üôÇ 

Every thought possible that could be designed by man is forcing its way to the surface.

We have to calculate thoughts between other thoughts together and find brevity

Our job is to answer all the questions; silencing the mind so, we can control our thoughts and thus bend reality to our will üôÇ

This was inspired when my frustration on a point of focus bent reality to my will or should I say... Disturbed reality? üôÇ

Gratitude is the state of mastership, so, we rather ask what is this trying to teach me? Instead of why me? in moments of frustration. It‚Äôs important not to play the victim. 

And then there‚Äôs the eightfold path. 

1. Right understanding (Samma ditthi)
2. Right Thought (Samma sankappa)
3. Right Speech (Samma vaca)¬†
4. Right action (Samma kammanta)
5. Right livelihood (Samma ajiva)¬†
6. Right effort (Samma Vayama)
7. Right mindfulness (Samma Sati)
8. Right concentration (Samma samadhi)

-

So, Alls life is, is a story going back in time to understand creation. We are an accumulation of the past, future and present. Souls could come from other planets as well as this? Are we all time travellers? We all have the ordinance of the entire universe. 

The universe being one long story, could be a fairy tale about Love. I would assume if the Universe is ‚Äútraditional‚Äù and it starts with ‚ÄúOnce upon a time‚Äù.  The beginning comes somewhere in the middle üôÇ  

Everything has its place and we want everything in its fitting place. Good and Evil can be seen as a spectrum. Intentions come into play and even consent so, there can be a greater good and a lesser evil.

In the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd dimension, Creation without love is just destruction and the greatest Sin. So, Action with love is the lesser evil. So, sex before marriage is the greatest Sin. In the Fourth dimension; to not accept what we know because we refuse to go through the pain is the next greatest Sin, which is to not accept ourselves or others. 

So, say I and another fall in love with each other and have sex, it is sin-free. One promises then one decides not to commit, it shatters the other person, is that not a Sin? To open up someone‚Äôs love and not love them back. 

For our good, it would be best to say only what we mean, what we can commit to, for expressed thoughts create our reality. What we put out comes back to us :) 

I am scared of no God, I just believe in basic human decency :) 

We all know what we are doing as we only do what we know. There comes an innocence as not everyone understands what we know. So, as well as accepting ourselves we have to accept others. Be forgiving. There comes a point of no return where we gain understanding, wisdom &amp; if we don‚Äôt change it ends in catastrophe.

We are all born sinners and none of us is free until we repent :)

A Sin‚Äôs definition could be to leave a footprint. With every action we are leaving our imprint on the universe and ourselves, we are always possessing one another, this is called psychic slavery :) 

Unconditional Love does not mean unconditional behaviour. Technically every Action is a form of Love, there is no objective Good and Evil but there is a correct way to Love, that is, without expectation. 

A Sin could be referred to as a lesson. All lessons have rewards. A Sin is the most unreal part of us, the person we are yet to become, these are the path to growth, the obstacles in life :) 

Karma is our idea‚Äôs we have developed through experience attracting people and another‚Äôs idea‚Äôs into our life that fit into our idea‚Äôs we have already developed from experience :) 

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs the memories we want to make for ourselves, we are creating an entity inside of us all the time, our consciousness. When we are alone this being inside of us becomes present, the entity we have created, that being we want to be something we can live with :)

As we can see consciousness is a manifestation of interactions. Our soul is an accumulation of our ancestors, all our and Angels and Demons. We are one soul, wisdom, philosophy, we are all different souls. We came here with lessons to learn passed down through generations already so, an old soul is wise, every generation is more advanced than the next. Children are the wisest on the planet. Children know they know but don‚Äôt know what they know until they are older.

No one has the right to judge :) 

-

This is how habits create a man. :) 

We are a result of our life choices. :)

Knowledge is power. :)

We can all know things but we have to apply knowledge alongside experience to gain understanding, wisdom :) 

-

The Greatest Sin in the Christian Bible is to eat from the tree of knowledge and to become like God or become God. 

The Greatest Sin in the Muslim Bible would be to practice Sorcery, which is to act like God.

That would be to learn the foundation, and truth behind Jesus‚Äôs and Muhammad's lie‚Äôs üôÇ 

The greatest Sin in my philosophy is to, not eat from the tree of knowledge and become God or like God üôÇ

To me, it‚Äôs a Sin not to learn the foundation which everything is built upon üôÇ

So I think carefully before I start thinking I‚Äôm a Christian, Muslim or anything because they have a little glimpse of truth to them üôÇ 

I just realised I am definitely, neither üôÇ 

I belong to The Order of Angels as my faith üôÇ 

My faith does not lie in imaginary beings or fear, my faith is grounded in life and other people like me üôÇ

My philosophy is pretty much about not lying to myself and being myself. üôÇ 

But... 

Lying to ourselves has its advantages as we do become the lies üôÇ 

So say we‚Äôre asleep, we can trick our mind into waking up üôÇ

We should not fear what we are capable of :) 

-

Eve doesn‚Äôt eat the fruit or she may, but never apply it, because it is rotten üôÇ 

Meaning females may never reach enlightenment the same way as men. üôÇ 

Men are made of order and logic because we are violent by nature üôÇ 

Women swim in chaos and own it üôÇ 

All's they care about is love üôÇ

Of course, men can act like women and women can act like men :) 

The feminine does not have a rational belief system though. :) 

Women have no rules :) 

Women have no ruler :) 

Us men are ruled by women :) 

There‚Äôs no nice way of putting this. 

Women have to accept they are Gods 

We men have to accept we are dogs :) 

We are indeed all women before we are a man, from in the womb, to how the mind develops :)

We are savages, so I understand the importance of a King &amp; Queen and to abide :) 

‚Äú A woman‚Äôs highest calling is to lead a man to his soul, to unite him with Source. Her lowest calling is to seduce, separating man from his soul and leave him aimlessly wandering. A man‚Äôs highest calling is to protect a woman, so she is free to walk the earth unharmed. Man‚Äôs lowest calling is to ambush and force his way into the life of a woman.‚Äù

Cherokee Proverb.

We all have three forces. 

We all have Karma, we are Karma. Wisdom. 

Then, we all have our Demons, our path. Our philosophy 

And, we all have our dreams, our idea of perfection. Where and what we see ourselves to be :) 

Everything is spiralling around us :)

The 5th dimension is where our lessons take us, where we become alive and life truly begins. This is where we are all connected at the heart‚Äôs and have empty minds, experiencing things like telepathy.  

This would be heaven. This is where we become free spirits. Everything has a spirit, all matter and thought are a manifestation of spirit.

Archons could be what set the limits on our wisdom &amp; philosophy. 

The greys could be the Devine perfect beings from the future that we will all metamorphose into. They could shapeshift, time travel &amp; take a hostage in our mind like a parasite. Everything gets smaller and closer to perfection. I think these are what create our negative thoughts, the beings preventing us from completing our challenges. They feed off of negative energy; if there‚Äôs no imperfection, they can‚Äôt exist. 

if we don‚Äôt pay attention to spirits, spirits lose their power, so, we may be able to kill death? Fear is a virus, the root of all Evil. 

-

I assume you know what to do. :)

Our purpose is to express ourselves to understand ourselves and the universe. 

Our purpose is to create memories we can create art out of. :)

We are perfect when we are ourselves :)

-

An awakening occurs through trauma when our life is shattered because the pain becomes too much or some action alters our perception. All this creates more awareness. It is like a military Sargent shouting at us to pick up all the pieces we have made of our life. 

It would be nice to create a world we don‚Äôt need a military Sargent to become a man but that‚Äôs not reality. 

I could only think the ideal is teachers discipline the children through martial arts and meditation techniques from being young

-

The mountain is metaphorical, the triangle of society. We can get to the top of a mountain anywhere without climbing a mountain. The idea of climbing a mountain for peace is to be alone unaffected by society. The mountain is right where you are. When we get to a point we are finally alone &amp; unaffected by society and we are at the top of a mountain. The internet is a good way of hooking up with other mountain climbers. A wise man once said it‚Äôs good to climb in a team with someone who knows the way :)

-

All life repeats the same story time and time until we become conscious of it, from an individual scale to a mass scale. 

Any book in history can be considered the tao or the way. 

If we are getting to know ‚ÄúGod‚Äù everything is spiritual and a layer of truth-speaking to us, we can even learn from the Bees :) 

Turning water into wine could be just a way of saying Jesus was good with words, a wordsmith or a poet üôÇ

-

I just silenced my mind and asked what is the meaning of life and the answer was worrying.

I think this is a good answer because...

If we‚Äôre not worried, we don‚Äôt care...

Meaning...

Something has no meaning to us...

If we‚Äôre worrying...

Something has meaning to us...

If we‚Äôre in our comfort zone...

There is nothing to worry about...

If we‚Äôre out of our comfort zone...

We worry and grow...

We could figure out what time our soul is from and the meaning of our souls name...

We‚Äôre trying to reach the infinite...

If the simulation wasn‚Äôt real 

I would be living in a fantasy. 

The simulation is real.

It will always be real.

So we call it a reality 

There‚Äôs no such thing as living in a fantasy

Everything we imagine is real üôÇ 

(Fa)ke - (Fa)ntasy 

(Re)al - (Re)ality

Finally...

Is the ‚ÄúUniverse is meaningless‚Äù a meaningless statement?

Is the phrase ‚ÄúEverything is a phase‚Äù a Phase?

And, What came first? The idea or the energy? Reality is made of ideas. Are our idea‚Äôs born out of energy or is energy born out of ideas? 

Reality - (Everything that is absolute) = The result of the probability of common idea‚Äôs coming together to create one idea, the common reality.

The Universe is absolute idealism. 

The universe is absolutely mental :)

Latin in ten minutes...

Latin is what they couldnt put into english

Back when they used Latin they thought of themselves as Gods

Karma is a curse they put on the world

They all believed they was karma and didn't understand themselves

They hope for spheres in Latin

That was a metaphor for heaven

Spheres was heaven to them and they worshipped spheres

They created heaven back then

And called it atmosphere

They had rules but couldn't see a globe.

They lived in fear of falling 

It's dead for a reason everyone was a sinner back then. 

If they truly behaved they would have been able to pronounce English like they tried to do

English is a highly conscious language..",LoveOracles,1641808455
324,awakened,The boiling pot metaphor,"Imagine you‚Äôre looking inside a pot of boiling water. The water is not still because of the heat from the stove, and you are in control of how much heat you give to the pot. You are the entire system, the stove the pot and the water. 

A common illusion we all experience is that people are able to control your emotions, but nobody can really go inside you and make you feel a certain way about things. We are always in control of the knob that boils the water, but it‚Äôs so easy for us to turn up the heat and lose sight of the reflection in the water. Practicing non-reaction has taught me to feel my emotions and find the source of them rather than just unconsciously reacting to whatever I‚Äôm feeling.",Different_County6867,1641804049
